You can get two 5090s for ~$5.4k even with scalper markup. We might not have benchmarks on the B60 but the raw specs indicate a B60 has 1/4 the FLOPs and memory bandwidth of a 5090.  Oh, and 2x 5090 gives you 64GB not 48GB of RAM.  I guess it&amp;#39;s in line with the 6000 Pro Blackwell though?  $10k for 2 dual B60  gives 96GB VRAM and 4x 1/4 performance is... uh... definitely worth the extra $1.5k.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I have no idea who would buy this.
