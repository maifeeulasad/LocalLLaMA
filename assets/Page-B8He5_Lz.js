Nathan Lambert talks a bit about this in his (in development) book on RLHF &lt;a href=\\"https://rlhfbook.com/\\"&gt;RLHF Book by Nathan Lambert&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#39;s possible to force this &amp;quot;wait&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;but&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;hold on&amp;quot; behavior in models by constraining the CoT length which affects accuracy of outputs. &lt;a href=\\"https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2503.04697\\"&gt;https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2503.04697&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;A bit of personal speculation on my part brought out through some experimentation investigating embeddings, some of which might end up as part of a paper a friend and I are looking to present at IC2S2.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Additional thing that I just remembered - The early versions of these models QwQ and Deepseek R1 Lite both had the tendency to switch freely between Chinese and English in their reasoning chains in the early releases, which to me implied an artifact of the unsupervised RL training reward function incentivizing compressed token length. Chinese characters are more information dense than English on a token by token basis. All I can say here, is that I would not be surprised if the RL training stumbled on Chinese as a less lossy method of compressing latent space encoding in its reasoning chains.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ol&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;","gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"distinguished":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":false,"link_id":"t3_1jaoy9g","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jaoy9g/meme_i_made/mhut5zi/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"report_reasons":null,"created":1742003731,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1742003731,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/LocalLLaMA","controversiality":0,"depth":2,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"mod_reports":[],"num_reports":null,"ups":2}}],"before":null}},"user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"mhui5gr","banned_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":"DELETED","no_follow":true,"author":"[deleted]","can_mod_post":false,"send_replies":true,"parent_id":"t1_mhtfqix","score":1,"approved_by":null,"report_reasons":null,"all_awardings":[],"subreddit_id":"t5_81eyvm","body":"[deleted]","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"collapsed":true,"downs":0,"is_submitter":false,"body_html":"&lt;div class=\\"md\\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[deleted]&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;","gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"subreddit_type":"public","can_gild":false,"top_awarded_type":null,"unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":"dark","score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jaoy9g/meme_i_made/mhui5gr/","num_reports":null,"locked":false,"name":"t1_mhui5gr","created":1741999797,"subreddit":"LocalLLaMA","author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1741999797,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/LocalLLaMA","controversiality":0,"depth":1,"author_flair_background_color":"","collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"mod_reports":[],"mod_note":null,"distinguished":null}},{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_81eyvm","approved_at_utc":null,"author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"awarders":[],"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"LocalLLaMA","author_flair_template_id":null,"likes":null,"replies":{"kind":"Listing","data":{"after":null,"dist":null,"modhash":"","geo_filter":"","children":[{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_81eyvm","approved_at_utc":null,"author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"awarders":[],"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"LocalLLaMA","author_flair_template_id":null,"likes":null,"replies":"","user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"misy5t9","banned_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Mr_International","can_mod_post":false,"send_replies":true,"parent_id":"t1_mispwtb","score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_4d2ah","removal_reason":null,"approved_by":null,"mod_note":null,"all_awardings":[],"body":"Funny thing, Anthropic released a post on their alignment blog that investigated this exact idea the day after I posted this and found that claude at least does not exhibit this behavior.
