I&amp;#39;ve seen so many people die and mourn. But one thing that&amp;#39;s stuck with me is how quickly we&amp;#39;re generally forgotten after our deaths. Having some kind of positive, dynamic, lasting impact on the world is an amazing legacy. And I&amp;#39;d argue that it being things that genuinely bring people happiness and a sense of fun is far more significant to who we are as people than traditional memorials. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sad to hear the story and the passing, but glad that it&amp;#39;s a story where there&amp;#39;s a lasting legacy to bring not just a bit of happiness to people but happiness that&amp;#39;s active.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;","gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"distinguished":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":false,"link_id":"t3_1m37o5r","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1m37o5r/drummers_cydonia_24b_v4_a_creative_finetune_of/n3vbpb3/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"report_reasons":null,"created":1752866302,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"collapsed":false,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/LocalLLaMA","controversiality":0,"depth":1,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"mod_reports":[],"num_reports":null,"ups":5}},{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_81eyvm","approved_at_utc":null,"author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"awarders":[],"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"LocalLLaMA","author_flair_template_id":null,"likes":null,"replies":"","user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"n3uri94","banned_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":false,"author":"TheLocalDrummer","can_mod_post":false,"created_utc":1752860432,"send_replies":true,"parent_id":"t1_n3uor0l","score":10,"author_fullname":"t2_w6l58p741","removal_reason":null,"approved_by":null,"mod_note":null,"all_awardings":[],"body":"Since you've mentioned it, the community would like to share SleepDeprived's work: [https://huggingface.co/collections/ReadyArt/sleeps-collection-687819b94f11b92759e10eae](https://huggingface.co/collections/ReadyArt/sleeps-collection-687819b94f11b92759e10eae)\\n\\n  \\nHe was very passionate about pushing the boundaries of ERP capability.
