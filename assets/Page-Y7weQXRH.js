Idle power usage is 9W... Max load is 270W.\\n\\nThat said, my Mac Mini M4 Pro (20c GPU) 64GB of unified RAM has a spec of 5W idle and 140W max load. But when typing this with a mouse and keyboard connected is only \\\\~7W from the wall. When it's inferring in LM Studio or Ollama, it's using a little under 70W from the wall.\\n\\nFor gaming a small percentage these days work natively under MacOS, but with huge libraries these days in Steam, even a small percentage means quite a few games work with MacOS natively. Those that don't work natively, quite a few work with CrossOver (something akin to Proton on Steam Deck), an some games I just use GFN for. Can I play everything? No. But with so many games available, I don't have to play everything, you can't play everything anymore. And if you *really* want you can run W11 ARM edition on a Parallels VM with pass-through to your M3 Ultra GPU cores, run the Windows game in the translation layer (x86 to ARM).\\n\\nWhy? Incredible amount of fast RAM (512GB), almost as fast as the VRAM on a 3090 or 4090 (about 10-20% slower), thus for an LLM you can run far bigger models. Sure they won't be fast, but I prefer good over fast. It won't be a space heater when inferring and more importantly, the other 95% of the time you use it it's using VERY little power. Less power usage translates to less heat, less AC required, saving even more power. It could easily mean the difference between being able to use the machine or not during summer.\\n\\nI've been using MS-DOS/Windows for the past 30-35 years as my primary OS, I've been using MacOS/Linux for decades as well, as well as supporting them. Especially the last 5 years I'm pretty much working in all three constantly (often for clients). So choosing one OS over the other isn't such a big deal anymore. Add to that the issues with W11 in gaming performance (and other stuff) vs. the amount of power vs energy efficiency Apple has been able to fit in very small form factors. I still run Windows and Linux on VMs, but also on barebone mini PCs and have a Steam Deck. So I'm not a mindless Apple fanboy, I'm just using what fits best for my needs. And YES, MacOS takes a while to get used to as your main OS, you'll need to figure out some things with apps, functions, etc. I'm pretty happy!","edited":false,"top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t1_n2prat5","is_submitter":false,"downs":0,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"body_html":"&lt;div class=\\"md\\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry, but for 10k I would not go for a Windows machine at all, but for a Mac Studio M3 Ultra with 512GB unified RAM. Idle power usage is 9W... Max load is 270W.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That said, my Mac Mini M4 Pro (20c GPU) 64GB of unified RAM has a spec of 5W idle and 140W max load. But when typing this with a mouse and keyboard connected is only ~7W from the wall. When it&amp;#39;s inferring in LM Studio or Ollama, it&amp;#39;s using a little under 70W from the wall.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;For gaming a small percentage these days work natively under MacOS, but with huge libraries these days in Steam, even a small percentage means quite a few games work with MacOS natively. Those that don&amp;#39;t work natively, quite a few work with CrossOver (something akin to Proton on Steam Deck), an some games I just use GFN for. Can I play everything? No. But with so many games available, I don&amp;#39;t have to play everything, you can&amp;#39;t play everything anymore. And if you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want you can run W11 ARM edition on a Parallels VM with pass-through to your M3 Ultra GPU cores, run the Windows game in the translation layer (x86 to ARM).&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Why? Incredible amount of fast RAM (512GB), almost as fast as the VRAM on a 3090 or 4090 (about 10-20% slower), thus for an LLM you can run far bigger models. Sure they won&amp;#39;t be fast, but I prefer good over fast. It won&amp;#39;t be a space heater when inferring and more importantly, the other 95% of the time you use it it&amp;#39;s using VERY little power. Less power usage translates to less heat, less AC required, saving even more power.
