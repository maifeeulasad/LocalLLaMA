I know this is &lt;a href=\\"/r/LocalLLaMA\\"&gt;/r/LocalLLaMA&lt;/a&gt; where numbers aren&amp;#39;t real anymore, but I do hope you&amp;#39;re joking considering what $20k could buy in terms of vehicles, housing, debt reduction, etc...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But back to what we really came here for: someone on the llama.cpp Kimi support thread reported peak ~20t/s TG using&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;a dual EPYC 9355 with 736gb ram in 23 channels (one of my rdimms is on RMA) and a blackwell 6000 pro with Kimi-K2-Instruct:1t:Q4_K_XL with NPS4&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I guess that&amp;#39;s probably not too far off $20k (~half for the Bk6000, thanks nvidia).  My single CPU Genoa with 3090 gets ~15t/s and that was maybe $6k.  I wager that most of their extra speed is due to offloading more layers to the GPU, but Turin is also a little faster than Genoa too.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Other alternatives would be to rent a server for like thousands of hours or buying just one Mac Studio, remain happy with Deepseek or run a smaller quant of Kimi, and spend $10k on &lt;del&gt;another hobby&lt;/del&gt; an RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell of course :)&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;","gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"distinguished":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":false,"link_id":"t3_1m0r95k","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1m0r95k/2_m3_ultras_512gb_running_kimi_k2_quant_4_with/n3bs8hk/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"report_reasons":null,"created":1752611355,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1752611355,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/LocalLLaMA","controversiality":0,"depth":2,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"mod_reports":[],"num_reports":null,"ups":3}}],"before":null}},"user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"n3bkoyu","banned_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":false,"author":"segmond","can_mod_post":false,"created_utc":1752609250,"send_replies":true,"parent_id":"t1_n3bhmmn","score":6,"author_fullname":"t2_ah13x","removal_reason":null,"approved_by":null,"mod_note":null,"all_awardings":[],"body":"what would be a better use than $20k for a hardware to run SOTA model?","edited":false,"top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t1_n3bkoyu","is_submitter":false,"downs":0,"author_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"llama.cpp"}],"author_patreon_flair":false,"body_html":"&lt;div class=\\"md\\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;what would be a better use than $20k for a hardware to run SOTA model?&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;","gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"distinguished":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":false,"link_id":"t3_1m0r95k","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":"light","score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1m0r95k/2_m3_ultras_512gb_running_kimi_k2_quant_4_with/n3bkoyu/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"report_reasons":null,"created":1752609250,"author_flair_text":"llama.cpp","treatment_tags":[],"collapsed":false,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/LocalLLaMA","controversiality":0,"depth":1,"author_flair_background_color":"#bbbdbf","collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"mod_reports":[],"num_reports":null,"ups":6}}],"before":null}},"user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"n3bhmmn","banned_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":false,"author":"eloquentemu","can_mod_post":false,"created_utc":1752608381,"send_replies":true,"parent_id":"t3_1m0r95k","score":5,"author_fullname":"t2_lpdsy","approved_by":null,"mod_note":null,"all_awardings":[],"collapsed":false,"body":"I hate it when they give a video instead of proper benchmarks...
