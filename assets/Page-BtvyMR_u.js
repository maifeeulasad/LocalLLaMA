For both workflows, the results seem effectively random, with no discernible pattern. The overall difference in performance is also fairly small, about 6% for prompt processing. Due to this, we would generally say that bandwidth has little effect on AI performance. However, we would caution that our LLM benchmark is very small, and LLM setups frequently involve multiple GPUs that are offloading some of the model to system RAM.
