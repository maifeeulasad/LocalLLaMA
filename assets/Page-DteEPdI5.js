Information Administration (NTIA) has released a report on dual-use foundation models with widely available model weights. Here is a summary:\\n\\n**Background**: Foundation models are artificial intelligence (AI) models that are trained on large datasets and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks. Dual-use foundation models refer to models that have both civilian and military applications.\\n\\n**Risks and Benefits**: The report identifies several risks and benefits associated with dual-use foundation models with widely available model weights. Risks include the potential for malicious use, such as creating deepfakes or AI-generated CSAM (child sexual abuse material), and the exacerbation of existing social biases. Benefits include the potential for increased transparency, accountability, and collaboration in AI research and development.\\n\\n**Uncertainty and Complexity**: The report acknowledges that the risks and benefits of dual-use foundation models are complex and uncertain, and that it is difficult to predict the full range of potential consequences.\\n\\n**Policy Approaches**: The report considers three policy approaches:\\n\\n1. **Restrict the availability of model weights**: This approach would limit access to model weights for dual-use foundation models, potentially reducing the risk of malicious use. However, this approach may also limit the benefits of open-source AI research and development.\\n2. **Continuously evaluate the dual-use foundation model ecosystem**: This approach would involve ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the risks and benefits of dual-use foundation models, allowing for more targeted and adaptive policy responses.\\n3. **Accept or promote openness**: This approach would prioritize the benefits of open-source AI research and development, potentially increasing transparency, accountability, and collaboration.\\n\\n**Recommendations**: The report recommends that the federal government take a three-part approach:\\n\\n1. **Collect evidence**: Gather and share data on the capabilities, limitations, and risks of dual-use foundation models.\\n2. **Evaluate evidence**: Analyze the collected data to determine when and how to intervene in the dual-use foundation model ecosystem.\\n3. **Act on evaluations**: Implement policy measures targeted at specific risks and benefits, such as restricting access to model weights or promoting transparency and accountability.\\n\\n**International Coordination**: The report emphasizes the importance of international coordination and cooperation in addressing the risks and benefits of dual-use foundation models.\\n\\nOverall, the report highlights the need for a nuanced and adaptive approach to regulating dual-use foundation models with widely available model weights, taking into account the complex and uncertain nature of the risks and benefits.\\n\\nProvider was Fireworks, 56376 input tokens.","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t1_lfpz4dx","is_submitter":false,"downs":0,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"body_html":"&lt;div class=\\"md\\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was actually genuinely curious as I haven&amp;#39;t had a good long context test for 405B, I&amp;#39;ve been trying it on openrouter.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So I did, and here&amp;#39;s the response.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) has released a report on dual-use foundation models with widely available model weights.

Risks include the potential for malicious use, such as creating deepfakes or AI-generated CSAM (child sexual abuse material), and the exacerbation of existing social biases. Benefits include the potential for increased transparency, accountability, and collaboration in AI research and development.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uncertainty and Complexity&lt;/strong&gt;: The report acknowledges that the risks and benefits of dual-use foundation models are complex and uncertain, and that it is difficult to predict the full range of potential consequences.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Policy Approaches&lt;/strong&gt;: The report considers three policy approaches:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;ol&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restrict the availability of model weights&lt;/strong&gt;: This approach would limit access to model weights for dual-use foundation models, potentially reducing the risk of malicious use. However, this approach may also limit the benefits of open-source AI research and development.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continuously evaluate the dual-use foundation model ecosystem&lt;/strong&gt;: This approach would involve ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the risks and benefits of dual-use foundation models, allowing for more targeted and adaptive policy responses.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accept or promote openness&lt;/strong&gt;: This approach would prioritize the benefits of open-source AI research and development, potentially increasing transparency, accountability, and collaboration.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ol&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;: The report recommends that the federal government take a three-part approach:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;ol&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collect evidence&lt;/strong&gt;: Gather and share data on the capabilities, limitations, and risks of dual-use foundation models.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluate evidence&lt;/strong&gt;: Analyze the collected data to determine when and how to intervene in the dual-use foundation model ecosystem.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Act on evaluations&lt;/strong&gt;: Implement policy measures targeted at specific risks and benefits, such as restricting access to model weights or promoting transparency and accountability.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ol&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;International Coordination&lt;/strong&gt;: The report emphasizes the importance of international coordination and cooperation in addressing the risks and benefits of dual-use foundation models.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Overall, the report highlights the need for a nuanced and adaptive approach to regulating dual-use foundation models with widely available model weights, taking into account the complex and uncertain nature of the risks and benefits.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Provider was Fireworks, 56376 input tokens.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;","gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"link_id":"t3_1efya2r","associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":true,"can_gild":false,"top_awarded_type":null,"unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"treatment_tags":[],"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1efya2r/white_house_says_no_need_to_restrict_opensource/lfpz4dx/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"report_reasons":null,"created":1722377395,"author_flair_text":null,"collapsed":false,"created_utc":1722377395,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/LocalLLaMA","controversiality":0,"depth":4,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"mod_reports":[],"num_reports":null,"ups":13}}],"before":null}},"user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"lfptccv","banned_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":false,"author":"[deleted]","can_mod_post":false,"send_replies":true,"parent_id":"t1_lfourty","score":30,"approved_by":null,"report_reasons":null,"all_awardings":[],"subreddit_id":"t5_81eyvm","body":"&gt;
