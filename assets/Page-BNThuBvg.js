FastAPI is great for single page application, which honestly I use very often because of it is quicker to set up when I am teaching myself something.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;For frontend I would recommend something like The Odin Project, it is fairly complete in a lot of the concepts.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I like gen ai engineering, I am not necessarily very good, but I am like you, trying to learn. I created a blog where I put my coding projects and gen AI projects that I have tried out. It needs better organization but it is here: &lt;a href=\\"http://danielkliewer.com\\"&gt;danielkliewer.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But for Python I would recommend Corey Schafer, he has a ton of youtube tutorials to follow along with, that is how I learned Flask and Django.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Hope you have fun learning.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\\"https://preview.redd.it/x8a9lqkvtgaf1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f2a0f8ddf329008cafd2b74f35595b7011a12452\\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/x8a9lqkvtgaf1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f2a0f8ddf329008cafd2b74f35595b7011a12452&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;","removal_reason":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"distinguished":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":false,"gildings":{},"unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1lpw26d/am_i_on_the_right_path_learning_react_flask_for/n0xxlgq/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"report_reasons":null,"created":1751464063,"media_metadata":{"x8a9lqkvtgaf1":{"status":"valid","e":"Image","m":"image/jpeg","p":[{"y":108,"x":108,"u":"https://preview.redd.it/x8a9lqkvtgaf1.jpeg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96f46d524b61e009959210a75fd2f66c6fd8a30a"},{"y":216,"x":216,"u":"https://preview.redd.it/x8a9lqkvtgaf1.jpeg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=abec7e9ac4d07fe0a7050364065b1a680426c34b"},{"y":320,"x":320,"u":"https://preview.redd.it/x8a9lqkvtgaf1.jpeg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d301fcc9a699907c4ac1dc7dc847eb3f0f9e83d"},{"y":640,"x":640,"u":"https://preview.redd.it/x8a9lqkvtgaf1.jpeg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6353578b8333937d13359e96cd61c05e8ba13f76"},{"y":960,"x":960,"u":"https://preview.redd.it/x8a9lqkvtgaf1.jpeg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ffbb756933eb4a87607695f905ed21c36f031d33"},{"y":1080,"x":1080,"u":"https://preview.redd.it/x8a9lqkvtgaf1.jpeg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=893d47812693179664f096099db4f7b58ac06556"}],"s":{"y":3024,"x":3024,"u":"https://preview.redd.it/x8a9lqkvtgaf1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2a0f8ddf329008cafd2b74f35595b7011a12452"},"id":"x8a9lqkvtgaf1"}},"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"link_id":"t3_1lpw26d","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/LocalLLaMA","controversiality":0,"depth":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"mod_reports":[],"num_reports":null,"ups":2}},{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_81eyvm","approved_at_utc":null,"author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"awarders":[],"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"LocalLLaMA","author_flair_template_id":null,"likes":null,"replies":"","user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"n0xxn3d","banned_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Prestigious_Thing797","can_mod_post":false,"created_utc":1751464077,"send_replies":true,"parent_id":"t3_1lpw26d","score":2,"author_fullname":"t2_1anh6qztwr","approved_by":null,"mod_note":null,"all_awardings":[],"collapsed":false,"body":"This is my preferred stack and I'm gainfully employed.
