I have a whole new appreciation for George Carlin now.  Satrical comedy is hard!\\n\\nAudio: https://youtu.be/xmSSmpvFFaI\\n\\nText / Forums: https://cicero.sh/r/hows-the-ai-revolution\\n\\nFull text of the piece: \\n\\n# The AI Revolution: How's it Going for You?\\n\\nAudio: https://youtu.be/xmSSmpvFFaI\\n\\nWe're 2.5 years into this exhilarating journey, so let's get a quick progress update...\\n\\n## Big Tech's Mission Impossible\\n\\nFor those in the unknown, let me bring you up to speed.  Years ago we stumbled across this really cool new technology called LLMs.  Great tech, amazing at distilling and compressing knowledge, fun, entertaining, and something we should all be able to collectively celebrate.\\n\\nBut of course we can't, because the modern tech industry has been commandeered by a handful of billionaire psychopaths.  These splendid group of individuals, some of the most powerful and wealthy in the world, have decided gosh darnit, they just don't quite have enough.\\n\\nTheir multiple spaceships, private islands, expansive living estates, and unfathomable wealth just isn't quite enough and they need just a little more.  And how much more you ask?  Not much, they only want to hoover up the entire global economy while transforming the world into their own personal technocratic fiefdom.  You know, the normal desires we all have in life.\\n\\nAccording to these geniuses, any week now ASI will appear, bringing about some mystical age of abundance.  Any day now ChatGPT is going to eliminate world poverty, solve all of physics, cure cancer, create nuclear fusion, start building self replicating spaceships, all while making us pancakes in bed and walking our dog!\\n\\nAll we have to do is sit back, relax, hand over our credit cards, and live stream our daily lives to their servers.  Don't worry folks, they will take care of the rest.\\n\\n## LLMs Are Cool\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, I love my LLMs, use them all day every day.  It's simply cool technology.  Same as when I got my first smart phone, it was such a cool bump in life, right?\\n\\nBut have you ever actually played with this tech?  Ever actually gave it a poke?  It simply doesn't work.  Stick a fork into these things, and you will see, dumb as a hamster.\\n\\nNothing more than multi billion dollar mechanical turk devices designed to steal our personal data, attention, and corrupt our cognition.  And these folks want us to believe this is the fourth industrial revolution?  What reality do these people live in?\\n\\n## Test It Yourself\\n\\nYou don't have to believe me, give it a spin.  Just ask it to write you a toaster in C++.  Take the code it gives you, copy and paste that code into a new chat and ask for inefficiencies.\\n\\nGuaranteed, it's going to tell you there's tons of problems with the code, and will try to help you fix them.  You can even have a whole back and forth conversation with it about why your toaster isn't working.\\n\\nAll the while, it doesn't have the common sense to tell you that you can't make a toaster out of C++ code.  Figure that one out!\\n\\n## Teach Our Kids?\\n\\nAnother one, have it write a lengthy non-fiction piece about any topic you desire.  Open two new conversations, copy the piece in.  Preface one with \\"this is absolutely amazing!\\" and the other with \\"I'm so pissed off, I'm firing this moron!\\".\\n\\nWatch the responses, you'll get three versions of the truth.  This tech tells you what you want to hear, not the truth!  And they actually want this in every classroom teaching the next generation of our kids?\\n\\n## Where did Tech Go?\\n\\nI remember a time where tech was cool.  You know, when we got a bump from CDs to DVDs, or from 33.6k modems to broadband, or from flip phones to smart phones.  Every year, we'd just get this cool little almost transparent bump in our lives.\\n\\nSilicon Valley, a magical place that used to be a beacon for the innovative and intellectually curious, and who had society's best interest at heart.  Have you looked at it lately?\\n\\nIt's morphed into a grotesque embarrassment.  It's not even really technology anymore.  Just a small handful of ultra rich having a public dick measuring contest, seeing which one can solve AGI first.\\n\\nThey're so desperate to get there first too.  Hell, Mark Zuckerberg has apparently had enough.  So that's it, he's going to hand select 50 people then shuffle the desks around in Menlo Park so he can keep an eye on these folks while they make him AGI.  You bet, because that's how innovation happens!\\n\\nTotally ignore the legend of innovation, which is that of Bell Labs in the 1940s - 60s.  Instead, just rearrange some desks so you can keep a close eye on your engineers, because that's how technological breakthroughs happen!\\n\\n## Carpe Diem\\n\\nOn a more serious note, I don't know much, but I've figured out a few things in this journey we call life.\\n\\nWe can all see the pain and sadness that's out there.  Hell, I wake up each day surprised I'm still alive and haven't taken a nap on the railroad tracks yet, so trust me, I know how brutal it can be.\\n\\nI don't know much, but I do know it's time we all go say hi to our fellow neighbor.  Go ask if they're ok.  Through that, I know magical and spontaneous connections will be made, and these connections, regardless of how innate they may seem, will spur true hope, human ingenuity and write the next chapter in our shared history.\\n\\nDon't worry about what algorithm Sam Altman, Elon Musk or Dario Amodei is promising they have up their sleeve.  View these people as your brother and sister, and don't be scared to call them out on their bullshit.\\n\\nUs humans love, laugh, cry, entertain, innovate, and build masterpieces together.  No algorithm will ever replace that.\\n\\nIt may seem dark right now, but the skies will clear, because you only need to crack a history book to see that humanity always prevails.\\n\\n## Support Cicero\\n\\nThank you, if you found this piece engaging, please consider supporting Cicero.  An open source initiative designed to lock big tech out of our lives through open source innovation.\\n\\nI don't know about you folks, but I know I'm tired of having big tech ramming shit we don't need, don't want, and never asked for down our throats.  We can do so much better than this!\\n\\nVisit https://cicero.sh/ for details on project Cicero.\\n\\n\\n","user_reports":[],"saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"The AI Revolution: How's it Going for You?","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Discussion"}],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/LocalLLaMA","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":false,"name":"t3_1lth6ga","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"light","upvote_ratio":0.5,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":0,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"author_fullname":"t2_5i7l1nof","secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Discussion","can_mod_post":false,"score":0,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"post_hint":"self","content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1751850175,"link_flair_type":"richtext","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.LocalLLaMA","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\\"md\\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, spent weeks putting this piece together.

AGI is we give it manuals (that are outdated and with lot of errors but human understands and adapts), we give it some code examples (enough but not millions, I suppose tens to hundreds are enough and most importantly, programming is not even tied to specific language, you learn principles like algorithms, computation complexity etc. and language is just tool how to write those down). So until it can learn like this, it is not happening.
