However, these detectors aren&amp;#39;t foolproof and can sometimes misclassify human-written text as AI-generated, especially if the writing is very formal or structured. I&amp;#39;ve see using a good humanizer like walterwrites ai to humanize, it can  bypass ai detection. It helps make AI generated text sound more human and undetectable by AI detectors like GPTZero. Not sure if this helps, but it&amp;#39;s been working for me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;","removal_reason":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"distinguished":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":false,"gildings":{},"unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1lokcrw/how_do_ai_detectors_work/n0provc/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"report_reasons":null,"created":1751350943,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"link_id":"t3_1lokcrw","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/LocalLLaMA","controversiality":0,"depth":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"mod_reports":[],"num_reports":null,"ups":0}},{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_81eyvm","approved_at_utc":null,"author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"awarders":[],"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"LocalLLaMA","author_flair_template_id":null,"likes":null,"replies":"","user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"n0nn7z7","banned_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":"LOW_SCORE","no_follow":true,"author":"AppearanceHeavy6724","can_mod_post":false,"created_utc":1751321465,"send_replies":true,"parent_id":"t3_1lokcrw","score":-11,"author_fullname":"t2_uz37qfx5","approved_by":null,"mod_note":null,"all_awardings":[],"collapsed":true,"body":"Of course they work; not very well but well enough.\\n\\nThey simply are trained on typical AI generated input, and every LLM have persistent patterns, aka slop. they simply catch it.","edited":false,"top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t1_n0nn7z7","is_submitter":false,"downs":0,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"body_html":"&lt;div class=\\"md\\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course they work; not very well but well enough.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They simply are trained on typical AI generated input, and every LLM have persistent patterns, aka slop. they simply catch it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;","removal_reason":null,"collapsed_reason":"comment score below threshold","distinguished":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":false,"gildings":{},"unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1lokcrw/how_do_ai_detectors_work/n0nn7z7/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"report_reasons":null,"created":1751321465,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"link_id":"t3_1lokcrw","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/LocalLLaMA","controversiality":0,"depth":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"mod_reports":[],"num_reports":null,"ups":-11}},{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_81eyvm","approved_at_utc":null,"author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"awarders":[],"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"LocalLLaMA","author_flair_template_id":null,"likes":null,"replies":"","user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"n0ntwly","banned_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":"LOW_SCORE","no_follow":true,"author":"Noreasonwhynot2000","can_mod_post":false,"created_utc":1751323658,"send_replies":true,"parent_id":"t3_1lokcrw","score":-15,"author_fullname":"t2_ia12kfs4q","approved_by":null,"mod_note":null,"all_awardings":[],"collapsed":true,"body":"AI detectors are an innovative, accurate and groundbreaking approach to text analysis.
