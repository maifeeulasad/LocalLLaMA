Java is one of the most used languages and used for decades. The problem is apart from stack overflow and other forums there is little public (non student) code. Java being used by businesses that don&amp;#39;t open source their backends results in this &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Rust being a relatively new language with few programmers in comparison could even yield better results.
