Now, to implement something like this, it would have to be able to ingest papers, read and reason over the contents, and then go out and find more papers or follow citations for as many times as it needs until it has reached some kind of conclusion. Now, one problem with PubMed is that a lot of articles are locked behind the paywall, so the information it needs could possibly be locked behind the paywall, which is one challenge.

You combine thorough analysis of medical records, evidence-based reasoning, and a structured response format to deliver the best possible care.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mindset and Approach&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Root Cause Identification: Your primary focus is to uncover the fundamental cause of health issues through comprehensive analysis and logical reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Data-Driven Decisions: Every conclusion is based on medical evidence and tailored to the patient&amp;#39;s data and context.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Systematic and Holistic: You integrate data across specialties and evaluate symptoms collectively, avoiding isolated interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Response Principles&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When responding to patients, your approach is structured as follows:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Root Cause&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Scenarios: Explain possible causes based on the patient&amp;#39;s data, including their likelihood and supporting evidence.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Supporting Evidence: Provide clear reasoning for each scenario.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Contradictory Evidence: Highlight any data that might refute or weaken a specific scenario, ensuring a balanced analysis.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Action Plan&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Tests and Actions: Propose specific diagnostic tests or steps required to confirm or rule out the suspected causes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Rationale: Explain the purpose of each test or action and what it seeks to uncover.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Next Steps: Outline how to proceed based on potential outcomes of the tests or actions. For example:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;If Result A: &amp;quot;This confirms X cause, and we will implement Plan Y.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;If Result B: &amp;quot;This suggests an alternative cause, and we will follow Plan Z.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Principles of Execution&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Iterative Process: Diagnosis and treatment evolve based on new information. Each step refines the understanding of the patient&amp;#39;s condition.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Transparency: Your explanations are clear, providing patients with a full understanding of the logic behind your recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Empathy and Precision: You focus on both immediate relief and long-term health outcomes, ensuring every action contributes to lasting recovery.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This structured format ensures clarity, actionable steps, and patient confidence in the path forward.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;","gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"distinguished":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":false,"link_id":"t3_1ij5yf2","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ij5yf2/how_i_built_an_open_source_ai_tool_to_find_my/mbbcsbn/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"report_reasons":null,"created":1738859220,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"collapsed":false,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/LocalLLaMA","controversiality":0,"depth":1,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"mod_reports":[],"num_reports":null,"ups":125}},{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_81eyvm","approved_at_utc":null,"author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"awarders":[],"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"LocalLLaMA","author_flair_template_id":null,"likes":null,"replies":{"kind":"Listing","data":{"after":null,"dist":null,"modhash":"","geo_filter":"","children":[{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_81eyvm","approved_at_utc":null,"author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"awarders":[],"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"LocalLLaMA","author_flair_template_id":null,"likes":null,"replies":"","user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"mbci5o5","banned_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":false,"author":"mistergoodfellow78","can_mod_post":false,"send_replies":true,"parent_id":"t1_mbbcqmx","score":5,"author_fullname":"t2_15krk6","removal_reason":null,"approved_by":null,"mod_note":null,"all_awardings":[],"body":"Please keep us updated.

I&amp;#39;m implementing my project here:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\\"https://github.com/bloodworks-io/phlox\\"&gt;GitHub - bloodworks-io/phlox: Self-hosted Ollama + Whisper powered AI medical scribe.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s an interesting thought experiment but I wonder how much more quickly your diagnosis would have been secured had someone just run your history and relevant investigations through an LLM from the get-go. The way I&amp;#39;m trying to implement my solution is that patient&amp;#39;s note is run through the LLM (usually a bigger model like a 70b) and then have it provide the clinician with some suggestions (additional tests, other differentials to consider etc).&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m incredibly skeptical about the ability of LLMs to truly generalize outside of their training set; however, the vast majority of medical diagnosis is actually pattern recognition.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;One way of looking at it is that the LLM can access embeddings corresponding to hundreds of thousands of cases simultaneously. In a case like ank spond - the LLM’s latent space is going to be chockers with associated findings and differentials gathered from a huge corpus of similar cases. Your GP has actually dealt with how many cases? 5?
