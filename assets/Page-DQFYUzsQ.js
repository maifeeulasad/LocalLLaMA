They&amp;#39;re &lt;em&gt;interpreting&lt;/em&gt; it.”&amp;quot;,&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;“That means they&amp;#39;re not just passive. They&amp;#39;re &lt;em&gt;active&lt;/em&gt;.”&amp;quot;,&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The structures were not just emitting a hum—they were &lt;em&gt;learning&lt;/em&gt; from the fish, adapting to their signals, forming a &lt;em&gt;dialogue&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;quot;,&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;“They&amp;#39;re not just amplifying the fish&amp;#39;s glow.
