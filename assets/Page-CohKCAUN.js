Pro tip: look at the Lian Li PSU that has its own internal USB headers hub. Using a USB A-to-A cable you can drive the internal headers from one of the external ports (so plug cable in back of PC, then feed it back into the case and plug into PSU - this cable is provided).

These are then easier to host on 4×3090 or 8×3090.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I built myself a 2x 4090 PC 9 months ago and only regret not getting a motherboard that can support more gpus. I get up 40 tok/s on 70B models with vllm which is very useable.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So my advice: Get a threadripper cpu that can support up to 256gb ram, then buy 3 more 3090s and you will have 350gb ram / vram. This will allow you to host at least a small deepseek quant and will help you wait out until a 200B or smaller model is released with similiar performance to the current Kimi K2.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;","removal_reason":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"distinguished":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":false,"gildings":{},"unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1m386sc/thoughts_on_this_deepseekr1kimi_k2_build/n3vzrqe/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"report_reasons":null,"created":1752873467,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"link_id":"t3_1m386sc","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/LocalLLaMA","controversiality":0,"depth":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"mod_reports":[],"num_reports":null,"ups":3}},{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_81eyvm","approved_at_utc":null,"author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"awarders":[],"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"LocalLLaMA","author_flair_template_id":null,"likes":null,"replies":{"kind":"Listing","data":{"after":null,"dist":null,"modhash":"","geo_filter":"","children":[{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_81eyvm","approved_at_utc":null,"author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"awarders":[],"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"LocalLLaMA","author_flair_template_id":null,"likes":null,"replies":{"kind":"Listing","data":{"after":null,"dist":null,"modhash":"","geo_filter":"","children":[{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_81eyvm","approved_at_utc":null,"author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"awarders":[],"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"LocalLLaMA","author_flair_template_id":null,"likes":null,"replies":{"kind":"Listing","data":{"after":null,"dist":null,"modhash":"","geo_filter":"","children":[{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_81eyvm","approved_at_utc":null,"author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"awarders":[],"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"LocalLLaMA","author_flair_template_id":null,"likes":null,"replies":{"kind":"Listing","data":{"after":null,"dist":null,"modhash":"","geo_filter":"","children":[{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_81eyvm","approved_at_utc":null,"author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"awarders":[],"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"LocalLLaMA","author_flair_template_id":null,"distinguished":null,"likes":null,"replies":{"kind":"Listing","data":{"after":null,"dist":null,"modhash":"","geo_filter":"","children":[{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_81eyvm","approved_at_utc":null,"author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"awarders":[],"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"LocalLLaMA","author_flair_template_id":null,"distinguished":null,"likes":null,"replies":"","user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"n3w12ty","banned_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"MidnightProgrammer","can_mod_post":false,"send_replies":true,"parent_id":"t1_n3w0rrt","score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_ijzb7","approved_by":null,"mod_note":null,"all_awardings":[],"body":"Yeah that’s the problem.
