Data/statistics can cause blindness, as much as lack of data, especially when you are on the early slope of an S-curve. My first-year physics professor said, \\"Every physical exponential is really a logistic curve in disguise\\". Faith in exponentials is a modern myth. For example, Moore's Law has been dead for 10+ years. Yes, the # of transistors is increasing slightly from process to process, but not at the exponential rate it once was. The S-curve we were always on has now become visible.\\n\\nThis \\"exponential growth\\" myth is feeding another even bigger myth: \\"Scale solves everything\\". The idea is that we just need to invent the \\"kernel of intelligence\\" and then, after that, just scale-baby-scale. The problem, here, is that problems scale much faster than algorithms that can solve those problems. The Busy Beaver (a problem) scales faster than any computable function (algorithms that can solve problems, like computing big numbers). So, scale doesn't solve everything, in fact, the space of problems that can be solved by sheer scaling is on the strongest possible law of diminishing returns -- if scale alone can solve your problem, then it's a very easy problem (trivially parallelizable problems are among the easiest problems in the computational complexity hierarchy). Hard problems are, by definition, problems that *can't* be solved by sheer scaling.\\n\\nGiven these provable facts (no guessing, curve-fitting or \\"empirical data\\" involved), the current zeitgeist is on an unsustainable trajectory, which is becoming more obvious by the day. \\"I was promised cosmic hyper-intelligence and all I got was viral Bigfoot Vlog videos, and this stupid T-shirt.\\" No doubt, Transformers are a revolutionary technological development, perhaps on a par with the Gutenberg Press. And while the Gutenberg Press eventually made the writing of *Principia Mathematica* possible, the *Principia* didn't just fall out of the Gutenberg Press by \\"scaling\\". Something had to be added to the printing press in order to get to the *Principia*, namely, hundreds of thousands or millions of hours of human sweat. You don't \\"just scale\\" your way up to solving the truly hardest problems. And giving yourself honor awards in the form of strawman benchmarks that can be annihilated by pre-trained systems with large enough memory is an exercise in delusion.\\n\\nThe missing ingredient is what the GOFAI symbolic-AI school calls *cognitive architecture*. A Transformer is a kind of cognitive architecture, but it's so simplistic that it would have to be scaled to googolplex (far beyond the scale that the observable universe could contain) in order to reach human levels of intelligence. So, scaling up pre-training-based AI is doing intelligence in the most difficult way possible. A little cognitive architecture can save unbounded amounts of \\"scaling\\". I'm reminded of Tesla's quote about Edison:\\n\\n&gt; “His [Thomas Edison] method was inefficient in the extreme, for an immense ground had to be covered to get anything at all unless blind chance intervened and, at first, I was almost a sorry witness of his doings, knowing that just a little theory and calculation would have saved him 90 per cent of the labor. But he had a veritable contempt for book learning and mathematical knowledge, trusting himself entirely to his inventor's instinct and practical American sense. In view of this, the truly prodigious amount of his actual accomplishments is little short of a miracle.” (Nikola Tesla)\\n\\nPre-training-based AI is the \\"Edison\\", cognitive architecture is the \\"Tesla\\". Just a little theory and calculation will cut the required pre-training by far more than 90%. Right now, the funnel through which AI theory has to pass is VC funding. It's not that we don't have the ideas out there to build the next-generation of AI -- we have lots of credible research ideas that have already been PoC'd! We *know* these systems work. But VCs come from the world of finance and they do not understand computational complexity theory, which is notoriously counter-intuitive, even by the standards of advanced mathematics! VCs don't care about halting problems or Busy Beavers, they just want to know \\"what scales\\"? And Transformers scale. So VCs only care about Transformers and pre-training-based AI, because we can prove that those scale. So, pre-training-based AI will go on sucking up all the oxygen in the room until the present AI bubble bursts. When there is a raft of major AI bankruptcies in the headlines, the word will finally get around that Transformers can't \\"just scale\\" to infinity. You actually need to sit down and do a little \\"theory and calculation\\" to get to the next major AI breakthrough.\\n\\nIn the future, I predict that we will have LMs that are on par with, say, LLaMa 3.1 405B and fit in megabytes, not gigabytes. Tokens/sec running purely on CPU will be in the thousands or even tens of thousands. These models will not have knowledge of the world, but they will be able to do highly reliable tool queries to search for the facts they need, whether from local storage or the Web. In addition, LMs will stop being the executive core of AIs (especially agentic AIs) and will be replaced by GOFAI modules that are trained from the ground up to be fit-for-purpose, that is, trained to be an executive controller. The instability of LMs for AI applications arises from the fact that a language model simply is not suited to be an executive controller. In the end, LMs are just I/O modules, they have no real logic capability, nor do they have stable controller capability.\\n\\nWhere pre-training-based AIs will help is that we can now move much faster along all the intermediate steps required for training real AI. We can prepare training data-sets much faster, we can iterate over architectures much more rapidly, and so on, and so forth. So pre-training-based AIs have definitely accelerated the arrival of real AI, by orders of magnitude. But LLMs themselves are not what we're looking for, and never will be.

The discovery of an architecture that is far more efficient is paramount to the evolution of LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;","removal_reason":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"distinguished":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":false,"gildings":{},"unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1lxv6a5/what_drives_progress_in_newer_llms/n2rl03d/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"report_reasons":null,"created":1752343801,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"link_id":"t3_1lxv6a5","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/LocalLLaMA","controversiality":0,"depth":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"mod_reports":[],"num_reports":null,"ups":1}},{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_81eyvm","approved_at_utc":null,"author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"awarders":[],"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"LocalLLaMA","author_flair_template_id":null,"likes":null,"replies":"","user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"n2s4908","banned_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"ASTRdeca","can_mod_post":false,"created_utc":1752349983,"send_replies":true,"parent_id":"t3_1lxv6a5","score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_e11po","approved_by":null,"mod_note":null,"all_awardings":[],"collapsed":false,"body":"scale","edited":false,"top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t1_n2s4908","is_submitter":false,"downs":0,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"body_html":"&lt;div class=\\"md\\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;scale&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;","removal_reason":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"distinguished":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":false,"gildings":{},"unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1lxv6a5/what_drives_progress_in_newer_llms/n2s4908/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"report_reasons":null,"created":1752349983,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"link_id":"t3_1lxv6a5","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/LocalLLaMA","controversiality":0,"depth":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"mod_reports":[],"num_reports":null,"ups":1}},{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_81eyvm","approved_at_utc":null,"author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"awarders":[],"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"LocalLLaMA","author_flair_template_id":null,"likes":null,"replies":"","user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"n2ug5q3","banned_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"bralynn2222","can_mod_post":false,"created_utc":1752380556,"send_replies":true,"parent_id":"t3_1lxv6a5","score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_769j0jzd","approved_by":null,"mod_note":null,"all_awardings":[],"collapsed":false,"body":"Everything down to each individual token in a data set affects the overall quality model then the organization of data within the data set can produce completely different models meaning infinite experimentation that needs to be done to find the true perfect or optimal organization, as well as as optimal data itself we are simply in a labor shortage there are not enough minds to fully map out and try every possible approach we currently have and the number of approaches grows every day This is just for base models now we bring the entirely other world of fine-tuning a model, which is the process of teaching a model how to use the knowledge it has properly which is another practically infinite field of experimenting possibilities that need to be done so as it currently stands our biggest problem is absolutely not needing more data.
