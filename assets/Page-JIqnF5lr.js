You just provide one audio file (in any language) and it will extremely accurately clone the voice style and rhythm. It sounds much more accurate than MaskGCT and F5-TTS, two of the other state-of-the-art local models.\\n- Optional: Zero-shot emotion cloning by providing a second audio file that contains the emotional state to emulate. This affects things thing whispering, screaming, fear, desire, anger, etc. This is a world-first.\\n- Optional: Text control of emotions, without needing a 2nd audio file. You can just write what emotions should be used.\\n- Optional: Full control over how long the output will be, which makes it perfect for dubbing movies. This is a world-first. Alternatively you can run it in standard \\"free length\\" mode where it automatically lets the audio become as long as necessary.\\n- Supported text to speech languages that it can output: English and Chinese. Like most models.\\n\\nHere's a few real-world use cases:\\n\\n- Take an Anime, clone the voice of the original character, clone the emotion of the original performance, and make them read the English script, and tell it how long the performance should last. You will now have the exact same voice and emotions reading the English translation with a good performance that's the perfect length for dubbing.\\n- Take one voice sample, and make it say anything, with full text-based control of what emotions the speaker should perform.\\n- Take two voice samples, one being the speaker voice and the other being the emotional performance, and then make it say anything with full text-based control.\\n\\n## So how did it leak?\\n\\n- They have been preparing a website at https://index-tts2.github.io/ which is not public yet, but their repo for the site is already public. Via that repo you can explore the presentation they've been preparing, along with demo files.\\n- Here's an example demo file with dubbing from Chinese to English, showing how damn good this TTS model is at conveying emotions. The voice performance it gives is good enough that I could happily watch an entire movie or TV show dubbed with this AI model: https://index-tts.github.io/index-tts2.github.io/ex6/Empresses_in_the_Palace_1.mp4\\n- The entire presentation page is here: https://index-tts.github.io/index-tts2.github.io/\\n- To download all demos and watch the HTML presentation locally, you can also \\"git clone https://github.com/index-tts/index-tts2.github.io.git\\".\\n\\nI can't wait to play around with this. Absolutely crazy how realistic these AI voice emotions are! This is approaching actual *acting!* Bravo, Bilibili, the company behind this research!\\n\\nThey are planning to release it \\"soon\\", and considering the state of everything (paper came out on June 23rd, and the website is practically finished) I'd say it's coming this month or the next. Update: The public release will not be this month (they are still busy fine-tuning), but maybe next month.\\n\\nTheir previous model was Apache 2 license, both for the source code and the weights.

So it will not release this month, but late next month is more likely.\\n\\nAnd if I understood correctly, it will be free and open for non-commercial use (same as their older models). They are considering whether to require a separate commercial license for commercial usage, which makes sense since this is state of the art and very useful for dubbing movies/anime.
