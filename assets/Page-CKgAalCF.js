Even OpenAI, who introduced the &amp;quot;industry standard&amp;quot; APIs, now have marked their text completion APIs as &amp;quot;legacy&amp;quot; and put a notice saying that &amp;quot;Most developer should use our Chat Completions API to leverage our best and newest models.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Still, technically there&amp;#39;s nothing that prevents an LLM itself from supporting raw text completion mode. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I have a custom-built frontend and I work around the lack of text completion by dumping as much context as possible into &amp;quot;assistant&amp;quot; role messages, so that it thinks it is writing everything. So, even for multicharacter roleplays with a few user-controlled characters I make the LLM continue what it had written before. However, some APIs do not permit multiple subsequent assistant messages, so I have to insert &amp;quot;Continue&amp;quot; messages from &amp;quot;user&amp;quot; role, and for some models it does not work well. Sometimes this behavior gets broken between model releases. Gemini 2.0 models worked quite well with this hacky approach, but, surprisingly, 2.5 series sometimes ignore the character lead line (&amp;quot;Name: &amp;quot;) at the end of the context and sometimes may continue from another character&amp;#39;s perspective. This is especially annoying for &amp;quot;write for me&amp;quot; functionality, when the model ignores the character lead line and writes for whomever.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;With local models, it is much easier to control - you can even use the same chat completion endpoint with a simple dummy chat template that any LLM can understand and use for continuing the context.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;","gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"link_id":"t3_1lylo75","associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":false,"top_awarded_type":null,"unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"treatment_tags":[],"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1lylo75/kimik2_takes_top_spot_on_eqbench3_and_creative/n2vtn9d/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"report_reasons":null,"created":1752407446,"author_flair_text":null,"collapsed":false,"created_utc":1752407446,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/LocalLLaMA","controversiality":0,"depth":4,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"mod_reports":[],"num_reports":null,"ups":18}}],"before":null}},"user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"n2vo9ow","banned_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":false,"author":"TheRealGentlefox","can_mod_post":false,"send_replies":true,"parent_id":"t1_n2v3ub6","score":28,"author_fullname":"t2_f471r","removal_reason":null,"approved_by":null,"mod_note":null,"all_awardings":[],"collapsed":false,"body":"I'm pretty sure they are referring to Chat Completion and Text Completion API call styles.
