I would love a repository of notebooks showing how to use each of these OCR tools, I've started one a bit with some OCR tools I've used.\\n* I'm not seeing anything about how \\"well\\" the OCR does. Just a yes/no. For instance in my practice tesseract works quite well for typed text, but fails hard for handwritten text. But it's not quite a simple as it does typed text or not. Surya for instance in my tests was 98.48% accurate on my typed text, while tesseract was 97.59%. I hand transcribed 50 docs for 88 pages in my past work since I was working with a specific dataset, but you can probably productionalize this much more on known datasets (though some not-in-training-data datasets would be great).\\n* It would be great to have the versions as well, surya v1 vs v2 had a big jump in quality for instance, ditto for tesseract v3 vs v4, plus I assume you're using the base tesseract for instance, not tessdata_best\\n* Another factor that would be huge is time. For instance the biggest advantage of tesseract is that it is *fast*. It's why the Internet Archive uses it still. I was able to iterate over 88 pages in 200 seconds single threaded, on my 5950X it took about 15 seconds multithreaded, while TrOCR took ten minutes on my 3080. Though if we use time, the settings matter, Surya ranges from three minutes to ten minutes depending on the batch settings for me, it's very sensitive to that.\\n* If you are doing a measurement of accuracy, I'd suggest a just doing jaccard, levensthein, and cosine and reporting all three, it's quite useful to see how they compare.\\n* I assume you are only doing English documents? That is one thing to note as I know paddocr is good for English, nto great, but it is actually pretty damn good at Chinese. \\n* If we're getting all the details, how deployable a model is matters quite a bit. E.g. is it small enough to fit on an edge device, phone, etc...\\n* Oh, I assume you're not doing any preprocessing?

I would love a repository of notebooks showing how to use each of these OCR tools, I&amp;#39;ve started one a bit with some OCR tools I&amp;#39;ve used.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#39;m not seeing anything about how &amp;quot;well&amp;quot; the OCR does. Just a yes/no. For instance in my practice tesseract works quite well for typed text, but fails hard for handwritten text. But it&amp;#39;s not quite a simple as it does typed text or not. Surya for instance in my tests was 98.48% accurate on my typed text, while tesseract was 97.59%. I hand transcribed 50 docs for 88 pages in my past work since I was working with a specific dataset, but you can probably productionalize this much more on known datasets (though some not-in-training-data datasets would be great).&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;It would be great to have the versions as well, surya v1 vs v2 had a big jump in quality for instance, ditto for tesseract v3 vs v4, plus I assume you&amp;#39;re using the base tesseract for instance, not tessdata_best&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Another factor that would be huge is time. For instance the biggest advantage of tesseract is that it is &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;#39;s why the Internet Archive uses it still. I was able to iterate over 88 pages in 200 seconds single threaded, on my 5950X it took about 15 seconds multithreaded, while TrOCR took ten minutes on my 3080. Though if we use time, the settings matter, Surya ranges from three minutes to ten minutes depending on the batch settings for me, it&amp;#39;s very sensitive to that.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;If you are doing a measurement of accuracy, I&amp;#39;d suggest a just doing jaccard, levensthein, and cosine and reporting all three, it&amp;#39;s quite useful to see how they compare.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;I assume you are only doing English documents? That is one thing to note as I know paddocr is good for English, nto great, but it is actually pretty damn good at Chinese. &lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;If we&amp;#39;re getting all the details, how deployable a model is matters quite a bit. E.g. is it small enough to fit on an edge device, phone, etc...&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Oh, I assume you&amp;#39;re not doing any preprocessing?
