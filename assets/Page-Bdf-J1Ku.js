Big players like OpenAI have to keep pushing the envelope because open-source projects are always nipping at their heels. If OpenAI slowed down, open-source alternatives could catch up fast. They’re already sprinting to improve functionality, and any pause from the big guys gives them time to enhance user experience.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So, while not everyone cares about open-source or privacy, it’s enough of a factor to shape the market and fuel innovation.

I can't guess whether or not Sam knew about Meta's release ahead of schedule; maybe he did, maybe he didn't.  The fact that 4o is an incremental upgrade, rather than a release of 5, implies to me that OpenAI were caught unaware, and rushed out something in order to make sure they didn't lose too much market share.\\n\\n&gt; Why is OpenAI providing their most powerful (publicly available) model for free?\\n\\nBecause Meta, Mistral, and Anthropic have all had big releases since OpenAI's last release.  OpenAI most likely don't want to be the company who were seen to pioneer language models, but then got left behind by everyone else.  Letting 4o be temporarily free is a way of preventing too much loss of market share to Llama3 and Claude.\\n\\nNot only that, but OpenAI are known as the \\"product\\" AI company.  If you want a local LM, then you download Llama3 or Mixtral, and it's understood that you either do a lot of the work yourself, or use other open source elements in the stack.  OpenAI are the equivalent of McDonald's.  You go to their site and all of the back end work is done for you.  That's a very lucrative market; in fact it's probably the most lucrative sector for AI, because it's the one that the non-technical majority are willing to pay for.  OpenAI are not going to want to lose that, which means that if all of the other players are making big releases, they are going to rush whatever they can out the door, and let people use it for free until 5 finishes cooking.\\n\\nAlso, yes, corporate executives are more or less always sociopathic.  That probably includes Sam himself.  He's very arrogant at least; I know that much.  But rather than just demonising executives as \\"evil,\\" what I've started to want recently, is to try and communicate to them that having more integrity is ultimately in their own best interests, as much or more than it helps everyone else.

I can&amp;#39;t guess whether or not Sam knew about Meta&amp;#39;s release ahead of schedule; maybe he did, maybe he didn&amp;#39;t.  The fact that 4o is an incremental upgrade, rather than a release of 5, implies to me that OpenAI were caught unaware, and rushed out something in order to make sure they didn&amp;#39;t lose too much market share.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Why is OpenAI providing their most powerful (publicly available) model for free?&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Because Meta, Mistral, and Anthropic have all had big releases since OpenAI&amp;#39;s last release.  OpenAI most likely don&amp;#39;t want to be the company who were seen to pioneer language models, but then got left behind by everyone else.  Letting 4o be temporarily free is a way of preventing too much loss of market share to Llama3 and Claude.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Not only that, but OpenAI are known as the &amp;quot;product&amp;quot; AI company.  If you want a local LM, then you download Llama3 or Mixtral, and it&amp;#39;s understood that you either do a lot of the work yourself, or use other open source elements in the stack.  OpenAI are the equivalent of McDonald&amp;#39;s.  You go to their site and all of the back end work is done for you.  That&amp;#39;s a very lucrative market; in fact it&amp;#39;s probably the most lucrative sector for AI, because it&amp;#39;s the one that the non-technical majority are willing to pay for.  OpenAI are not going to want to lose that, which means that if all of the other players are making big releases, they are going to rush whatever they can out the door, and let people use it for free until 5 finishes cooking.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Also, yes, corporate executives are more or less always sociopathic.  That probably includes Sam himself.  He&amp;#39;s very arrogant at least; I know that much.
