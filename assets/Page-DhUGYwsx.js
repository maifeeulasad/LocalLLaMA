What you’re seeing is that even if you have access to like more recent data. Like you have access to 2025 or 2024 data a model just does better than models trained up to 2023 data. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’m not saying these claims are untrue btw. However I do believe for the size of the model they are definitely undertrained vs from what they could be used as IF we had the data for it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;","gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"distinguished":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":false,"link_id":"t3_1lx4qhp","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1lx4qhp/moonshot_ai_about_to_release_their_1t_parameters/n2mfk1c/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"report_reasons":null,"created":1752269234,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1752269234,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/LocalLLaMA","controversiality":0,"depth":2,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"mod_reports":[],"num_reports":null,"ups":2}},{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_81eyvm","approved_at_utc":null,"author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"awarders":[],"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"LocalLLaMA","author_flair_template_id":null,"likes":null,"replies":"","user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"n2njufe","banned_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"MINIMAN10001","can_mod_post":false,"send_replies":true,"parent_id":"t1_n2lr4hl","score":2,"author_fullname":"t2_15mrcb","removal_reason":null,"approved_by":null,"mod_note":null,"all_awardings":[],"body":"I remember there being mention of a study where once the training data no longer fit, the model started showing signs of generalization instead of memorization.","edited":false,"top_awarded_type":null,"downs":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t1_n2njufe","is_submitter":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"body_html":"&lt;div class=\\"md\\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I remember there being mention of a study where once the training data no longer fit, the model started showing signs of generalization instead of memorization.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;","gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"distinguished":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":false,"link_id":"t3_1lx4qhp","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1lx4qhp/moonshot_ai_about_to_release_their_1t_parameters/n2njufe/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"report_reasons":null,"created":1752283111,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1752283111,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/LocalLLaMA","controversiality":0,"depth":2,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"mod_reports":[],"num_reports":null,"ups":2}}],"before":null}},"user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"n2lr4hl","banned_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"YearZero","can_mod_post":false,"created_utc":1752261913,"send_replies":true,"parent_id":"t1_n2l8tzq","score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_4kpsn","removal_reason":null,"approved_by":null,"mod_note":null,"all_awardings":[],"body":"Wouldn't increasing model size while keeping dataset the same also improve performance?
