I suspect my use case is far from niche (Being Generic it's the opposite), so a thread discussing this could serve some purpose for the people.\\n\\nBy \\"General Purpose\\" I mean the system will have to fulfill the following criteria:\\n\\n* **Good for gaming:** Probably the real bottleneck here, so I am starting with this. It doesn't need to be \\"optimal for gaming\\", but ideally it shouldn't be a significant compromise either. This crosses out the Macs, unfortunately. Very known issue with high end Threadrippers is that while they do have tons of cores, the clock speeds are quite bad and so is the gaming performance. However, the lower end variants (XX45, XX55 perhaps even XX65) seem to on the spec sheet have significantly higher clock speeds, close to what the regular desktop counterparts of the same AMD generation have. When eyeballing the spec sheets, I don't see any massive red flags that would completely nerf the gaming performance with the lower end variants. Advantage over an EPYC build here would be the gaming capabilities.\\n* **Excellent LLM/ImgGen inference with partial CPU off-loading:** This is where most of the point of the build lies in. Now that even the lower end Threadrippers come with 8-Channels and chonky PCI-E Bandwidth support, a Threadripper with the GPUs seems quite attractive.  Local training capabilities being deprioritized as the advantages of using the cloud within this price range seem too great. But at least this system would have a very respectable capability to train as well, if need be.\\n* **Comprehensive Platform Support:** This is probably the largest question mark for me, as I come from quite \\"gamery\\" background, I have next to no experience with hardware beyond the common consumer models. As far as I know, there shouldn't be any issues where some driver etc would become an issue because of the Threadripper? But you don't know what you don't know, so I am just assuming that the overall universality of x86-64 CPUs applies here too.\\n* **DIU Components:** As a hobbyist I like the idea of being able to swap as many things if need be, and I'd like to be able to reuse my old PSU/Case and not pay for something I am not going to use, which means a prebuilt workstation would have to be an exceptionally good deal to be pragmatic for me.\\n\\nWith these criteria in mind, this is something I came up with as a starting point. **Do bear in mind that the included prices are just ballpark figures I pulled out of my rear**. There will be significant regional variance in either direction and it could be that I just didn't find the cheapest one available. I am just taking my local listed prices with VAT included and converting them to dollars for universality.\\n\\n* **Motherboard:** ASROCK WRX90 WS EVO **(\\\\~$1000)**\\n* **CPU:** The upcoming Threadripper Pro 9955WX (16/32 Core, 4.5GHz(5.4GHz Boost). Assuming these won't be OEM only. **(\\\\~$1700)**\\n* **RAM:** Kingston 256GB (8 x 32GB) FURY Renegade Pro (6000MHz) **(\\\\~$1700)**\\n* **GPU:** Used 4090 for ImgGen as the primary workhorse would be the thing I'd be getting, and then I'd slap in my old 3090 and 3060s in there too for extra LLM VRAM, maybe in the future replacing them with something better. System RAM being 8-channels @ 6000MHz should make the model not entirely fitting in VRAM much less of a compromise than it would normally be. **(\\\\~$1200, Used 4090, Not counting the cards I had)**\\n* **PSU:** Seasonic 2200W PRIME PX-2200. With these multi-GPU builds running out of power cables can become a problem. Sure, slapping in more PSU:s is always an option, but won't be the cleanest build if you don't have a case that can house them all. PSU in question can support up to 2x 12V-2x6 and 9x 8-pin PCIe cables. **($500)**\\n* **Storage:** 20TB HDD for model cold storage, 4TB SSD for frequently loaded models and everything else. **(\\\\~$800)**\\n* **Cooling:** Some WRX90 compatible AIO with a warranty **(\\\\~$500)**\\n* **Totaling:** **$7400** for 256GB 8-Channel 6000MHz RAM and 24GB of VRAM with a smooth upgrade path to add more VRAM by just beginning to build the 3090 Jenga tower for $500 each.
