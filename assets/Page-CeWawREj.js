LeCun&amp;#39;s words just generally lack consistency for quite some time now. I feel like he&amp;#39;s intentionally inconsistent as if he&amp;#39;s trying to be right by chance and win another award. Personally, if I was LeCun, I&amp;#39;d refuse to be put as a co-author for work that contradicts me in this amount, but maybe he doesn&amp;#39;t care or he&amp;#39;s just trying to citationmaxx.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;","removal_reason":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"distinguished":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":false,"gildings":{},"unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1lnf7eo/is_yann_lecun_changing_directions_prediction/n0epq33/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"report_reasons":null,"created":1751205512,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"link_id":"t3_1lnf7eo","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/LocalLLaMA","controversiality":0,"depth":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"mod_reports":[],"num_reports":null,"ups":4}},{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_81eyvm","approved_at_utc":null,"author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"awarders":[],"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"LocalLLaMA","author_flair_template_id":null,"likes":null,"replies":"","user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"n0fc0vc","banned_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"roofitor","can_mod_post":false,"created_utc":1751212749,"send_replies":true,"parent_id":"t3_1lnf7eo","score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_1l986ila61","approved_by":null,"mod_note":null,"all_awardings":[],"collapsed":false,"body":"Neat post, thank you.\\n\\nI imagine LeCun would be fine with autoregression in dynamic systems where hallucinations did not to compound.
