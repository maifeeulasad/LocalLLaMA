tech lead of a small startup (50ish employees) where the responsibility of DevOps normally falls to me, absolutely not any time soon.\\n\\nDevOps imo is actually one of the harder things in software engineering to get right. You have to optimize for uptime, performance, reliability (cold starts, etc.), and cost.\\n\\nWhen my CEO asks me to cut 10% of infrastructure costs, here's my process:\\n\\n1. Consider the entire infrastructure stack and determine which pieces are low or high priority. We wouldn't want additional latency on our payment gateway, but maybe slower PDF loads are acceptable\\n2. Consider if we are overprovisioned on things where performance degradation is acceptable\\n3. Consider creative solutions to cut some costs, often this involves caching something or moving some piece of infrastructure from on cloud service to another\\n4. Come up with a comprehensive proposal of various ways this can be achieved\\n5. Go back and forth with CEO on what can and can't be cut. For example, maybe he says our database costs are too high... fix it; but I know that we can't easily do that without fucking up our whole app's performance\\n5. Do a dry run, stress test, etc. to make sure our performance doesn't degrade to unacceptable level. This usually involves DAYS of mostly waiting around\\n6. Push the damn thing\\n7. Monitor to make sure the performance penalty is in line, maybe tweak a couple things \\n8.
