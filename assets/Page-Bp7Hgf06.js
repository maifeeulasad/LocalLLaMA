Furthermore, our findings indicate that the RL on top of the distilled checkpoint can yield even better performance, leading to over 5 points gain across various benchmarks&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Magistral Medium was trained with RL, and it was distilled into Magistral Small before further RL. The similarities are probably related to the data corpus they used for the foundational model.
