I collected all the NHANES Dexa data and formulated an idea of how my measurements correlated to that information. Then I noticed that a lot of fitness influencers actually post their Dexa scan data so I started compiling their information into the database and looked for patterns. Then I took all the details from my Apple Watch for activity, sleep, and meal details from macrofactor app, body weight scale, near infrared spectroscopy device (fancy caliper that used infrared to measure fat depth), and made an app to compile all of this information. Determined a method of tracking my metrics so I could figure out if my diet was pushing me in the right direction. Used all of that data and built a leaderboard comparing myself to celebrity, influencer, bodybuilder builds. It does a ton more like tells you if you have enough muscle to compete and in which categories (it can’t see your conditioning and overall shape…yet). I could literally talk all day about how it works haha\\n\\nPDF of transcript would be easier BUT you only get verbalized information. Majority of influencers don’t talk about their height or body segments but you can clearly see it written on the paper in the video. So you’d be missing a lot of data.

I collected all the NHANES Dexa data and formulated an idea of how my measurements correlated to that information. Then I noticed that a lot of fitness influencers actually post their Dexa scan data so I started compiling their information into the database and looked for patterns. Then I took all the details from my Apple Watch for activity, sleep, and meal details from macrofactor app, body weight scale, near infrared spectroscopy device (fancy caliper that used infrared to measure fat depth), and made an app to compile all of this information. Determined a method of tracking my metrics so I could figure out if my diet was pushing me in the right direction. Used all of that data and built a leaderboard comparing myself to celebrity, influencer, bodybuilder builds. It does a ton more like tells you if you have enough muscle to compete and in which categories (it can’t see your conditioning and overall shape…yet).
