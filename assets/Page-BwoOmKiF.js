This guide is focused only on local MCP servers offering tools using the STDIO transport. It will not go into authorizations or security. Since this is a subreddit about local models I am going to assume that people are running the MCP server locally and are using a local LLM. \\n\\n**What is an MCP server?**\\n\\nAn MCP server is basically just a script that watches for a call from the LLM. When it gets a call, it fulfills it by running and returns the results back to the LLM. It can do all sorts of things, but this guide is focused on **tools**.\\n\\n**What is a tool?**\\n\\nIt is a function that the LLM can activate which tells the computer running the server to do something like access a file or call a web API or add an entry to a database. If your computer can do it, then a tool can be made to do it. \\n\\n**Wait, you can't be serious? Are you stupid?**\\n\\nThe LLM doesn't get to do whatever it wants -- it only has access to tools that are specifically offered to it. As well, the client will ask the user to confirm before any tool is actually run. Don't worry so much!\\n\\n**Give me an example**\\n\\nSure! [I made this MCP server](https://github.com/jabberjabberjabber/llm-jukebox) as a demo. It will let the model download a song from youtube for you. All you have to do is ask for a song, and it will search youtube, find it, download the video, and then convert the video to MP3.\\n\\n[Check it out.](https://i.imgur.com/ipOFN8M.gif)\\n\\n**I want this!**\\n\\nOk, it is actually pretty easy once you have the right things in place.  What you need:\\n\\n- **An LLM frontend that can act as an MCP client**: Currently LM Studio and Jan can do this, not sure of any others but please let me know and I will add them to a list in an edit.\\n\\n- **A model that can handle tool calling**: Qwen 3 and Gemma 3 can do this. If you know of any others that work, again, let me know and I will add them to a list\\n\\n- **Python, UV and NPM**: These are the programs that handle the scripting language most MCP servers user\\n\\n- **A medium sized brain**: You need to be able to use the terminal and edit some JSON. You can do it; your brain is pretty good, right? Ok, well you can always ask an LLM for help, but MCP is pretty new so most LLMs aren't really too good with it\\n\\n- **A server**: you can use the one I made!\\n\\nHere is a step by step guide to get the llm-jukebox server working with LM Studio. You will need a new version of LM Studio to do this since MCP support was just recently added.\\n\\n1. Clone the repo or download and extract the zip\\n2. [Download and install UV if you don't have it](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)\\n2. Make sure you have ffmpeg. In windows open a terminal and type \`winget install ffmpeg\`, in Ubuntu or Debian do \`sudo apt install ffmpeg\`\\n3. Ensure you have a model that is trained to handle tools properly. Qwen 3 and Gemma 3 are good choices.\\n4. In LM Studio, click Developer mode, then Program, Tools and Integrations, the the arrow next to the Install button, and Edit mcp.json. Add the entry below under mcpServers \\n\\n**Note 1**: JSON is a very finicky format, if you mess up a single comma it won't work. Make sure you pay close attention to everything and make sure it is exactly the same except for the path. \\n\\n**Note 2**: You can't use backslashes in JSON files so Windows paths have to be changed to forward slashes. It still works with forward slashes.)\\n\\n\\n    \\"llm-jukebox\\": {\\n      \\"command\\": \\"uv\\",\\n      \\"args\\": [\\n    \\t\\"run\\",\\n    \\t\\"c:/path/to/llm-jukebox/server.py\\"\\n      ],\\n      \\"env\\": {\\n    \\t\\"DOWNLOAD_PATH\\": \\"c:/path/to/downloads\\"\\n      }\\n    }\\n    \\n\\nMake sure to change the paths to fit which paths the repo is in and where you want to the downloads to go.\\n\\nIf you have no other entries, the full JSON should look something like this:\\n\\n    {\\n      \\"mcpServers\\": {\\n        \\"llm-jukebox\\": {\\n          \\"command\\": \\"uv\\",\\n          \\"args\\": [\\n            \\"run\\",\\n            \\"c:/users/user/llm-jukebox/server.py\\"\\n          ],\\n          \\"env\\": {\\n            \\"DOWNLOAD_PATH\\": \\"c:/users/user/downloads\\"\\n          }\\n        }\\n      }\\n    }\\n\\nClick on the Save button or hit Ctrl+S.
