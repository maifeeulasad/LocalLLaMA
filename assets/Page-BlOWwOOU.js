You can also connect this to your own local model, but don&amp;#39;t expect results comparable to frontier models.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A 5090 would allow you to run Qwen 3 32B a Q6 with decent context length, but in all honesty, that&amp;#39;s not going to be a massive improvement. If you want to experience what coding with it is like, you may want to try it through OpenRouter. However, even 2 x 5090, while allowing you to run up to 70B, would still not really produce much better in terms of coding performance right now.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Having enough VRAM to run a frontier model is ideal, but will cost you upwards of $10,000. Ollama is a wrapper for the llama.cpp inference engine, which is the only one that allows you to run models on regular RAM. Since LLMs are memory bandwidth-bound, you can&amp;#39;t really run large models on consumer dual channel motherboards, but an 8-channel server with 512 GB of RAM can run frontier models reasonably well. This is because most of them are mixture of experts models, in which only a certain amount of parameters are active at a time, making them much faster.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;","gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"link_id":"t3_1m5lg47","associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":false,"top_awarded_type":null,"unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"treatment_tags":[],"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1m5lg47/best_local_models_per_budget_per_use_case/n4dxx5v/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"report_reasons":null,"created":1753122857,"author_flair_text":null,"collapsed":false,"created_utc":1753122857,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/LocalLLaMA","controversiality":0,"depth":4,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"mod_reports":[],"num_reports":null,"ups":1}}],"before":null}},"user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"n4duwg8","banned_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Expensive-Fail3009","can_mod_post":false,"send_replies":true,"parent_id":"t1_n4dtjsp","score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_upzzregs","removal_reason":null,"approved_by":null,"mod_note":null,"all_awardings":[],"collapsed":false,"body":"I had no idea that I needed to change my context length on WebUI.
