We are in a point where it's very reasonable to get an AI model to make a work that follows your style very closely and that can cause massive damages to your bottom line and integrity.\\n\\nA famous example I'm aware of in music is the Drake and Weekend song that was AI generated that blew up a while back. It's a fantastic song (and tbh much better than anything Drake has made in a hot minute) but it's entirely reasonable for Drake to have sued the creator of the song.\\n\\nI don't think it's reasonable for Drake to sue the creators of the AI model under current law, but realistically, Drake *should* have had the opportunity to tell an AI company that he did not want his music to be replicated in any way, and therefore must be taken out of the AI's training pool.\\n\\nWhen an AI trains itself off of a musician's style, the musician's 'signature sound' is compromised heavily because you can just get an AI to replicate that sound and make it say whatever you want which can be very damaging for the musician's career. With how AI works, there's no reasonable way to prevent a clever prompt engineer from prompt engineering their way to stealing the artist's sound besides simply not having that sound in the AI's training set in general.\\n\\nI think that the only ethical way for an AI to push forwards is to send a request that it'll be training itself off of your work.
