Here are some other factors to consider:\\n\\n\\\\- Western professionals are primarily working directly for corporate because it pays far better than plain academia. Their research is often not published and is tailored towards specific business needs.\\n\\n\\\\- Wealth inequality in the U.S., at least, is high. Pursuing higher education is a privilege that many can't afford, and in many states this is by design. Post-grad is an even greater privilege that is also high-risk if you have to rely on student loans to pay tuition. Even lower public education is being intentionally crippled.\\n\\n\\\\- There is more legal and ethical tape for Western researchers to consider than there is for Chinese researchers.\\n\\nObviously, though, I don't exactly know what it's like to be raised in China.\\n\\nI do want to also push back on completely devaluing the social values of the West, because attaching a person's value to what they do or create is antithetical to their well-being. That is why there is a love and birthright crisis happening especially in Japan and Korea. They're fucking stressed. It's happening in other countries globally too, but it's very pronounced in that region. China, for now, is the relative outlier since it has been \\"modernizing\\" relatively late/recently compared to its neighbors.

Here are some other factors to consider:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;- Western professionals are primarily working directly for corporate because it pays far better than plain academia. Their research is often not published and is tailored towards specific business needs.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;- Wealth inequality in the U.S., at least, is high. Pursuing higher education is a privilege that many can&amp;#39;t afford, and in many states this is by design. Post-grad is an even greater privilege that is also high-risk if you have to rely on student loans to pay tuition. Even lower public education is being intentionally crippled.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;- There is more legal and ethical tape for Western researchers to consider than there is for Chinese researchers.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Obviously, though, I don&amp;#39;t exactly know what it&amp;#39;s like to be raised in China.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I do want to also push back on completely devaluing the social values of the West, because attaching a person&amp;#39;s value to what they do or create is antithetical to their well-being.
