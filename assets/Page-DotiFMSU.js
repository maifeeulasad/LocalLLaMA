**TL;DR**

* **Generative AI has gone mainstream** – 1 in 8 workers worldwide now uses AI every month, with 90% of that growth happening in the last 6 months. AI-native applications are now well into the billions of annual run rate revenue.
* **Scaling continues across all dimensions** – All technical metrics for models continue to improve &gt;10x year-over-year, including cost, intelligence, context windows, and more. The average duration of human task a model can reliably do is doubling every 7 months.
* **The economics of foundation models are confusing** – OpenAI &amp; Anthropic are showing truly unprecedented growth, accelerating at $B+ of annual revenue. But, end-to-end training costs for frontier models near $500M, and the typical model becomes obsolete within 3 weeks of launch thanks to competition &amp; open source convergence.
* **Just like the smartest humans, the smartest AI will “think before it speaks”** – Reasoning models trained to think before responding likely represent a new scaling law — but training them requires significant advances in post-training, including reinforcement learning &amp; reward models. Post-training may become more important than pre-training.
* **AI has now infiltrated almost all specialist professions** – From engineers and accountants to designers and lawyers, AI copilots and agents are now tackling high-value tasks in virtually all knowledge worker domains.
* **Agents finally work, but we are early in understanding how to build AI products** – Agents have finally hit the mainstream, but design patterns &amp; system architectures for AI products are still extremely early.
* **“AI-native” organizations will look very different** – Flatter teams of capable generalists will become the norm as generative AI lessens the value of specialized skills. Many roles will blur — such as product, design, &amp; engineering.`,user_reports:[],saved:!1,mod_reason_title:null,gilded:0,clicked:!1,title:"State of Foundation Models, 2025 | Innovation Endeavors",link_flair_richtext:[{e:"text",t:"Resources"}],subreddit_name_prefixed:"r/LocalLLaMA",hidden:!1,pwls:6,link_flair_css_class:"",downs:0,thumbnail_height:null,top_awarded_type:null,hide_score:!1,name:"t3_1lv910v",quarantine:!1,link_flair_text_color:"light",upvote_ratio:.91,author_flair_background_color:null,subreddit_type:"public",ups:8,total_awards_received:0,media_embed:{},thumbnail_width:null,author_flair_template_id:null,is_original_content:!1,author_fullname:"t2_1j3y97g682",secure_media:null,is_reddit_media_domain:!1,is_meta:!1,category:null,secure_media_embed:{},link_flair_text:"Resources",can_mod_post:!1,score:8,approved_by:null,is_created_from_ads_ui:!1,author_premium:!1,thumbnail:"self",edited:!1,author_flair_css_class:null,author_flair_richtext:[],gildings:{},content_categories:null,is_self:!0,mod_note:null,created:1752032984,link_flair_type:"richtext",wls:6,removed_by_category:null,banned_by:null,author_flair_type:"text",domain:"self.LocalLLaMA",allow_live_comments:!1,selftext_html:`&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://macro.com/app/pdf/696626a1-216b-493a-a0dd-181ce51ce327"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State of Foundation Models, 2025 | Innovation Endeavors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
