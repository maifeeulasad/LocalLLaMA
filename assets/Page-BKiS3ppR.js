Here's why, and what we can estimate:\\n\\nWhy a Precise Number is Hard to Find:\\n\\nLack of Standardized Testing and Record Keeping: In the 1870s, material science and testing weren't as standardized as they are today. While there was growing interest in material properties, routine, widespread testing and detailed record-keeping of yield strengths for every batch of gun steel were not common practice. Data from that era, if it exists, might be scattered, inconsistent, or use different measurement methods compared to modern standards.\\n\\nVariability in Steel Production: Steel production in the 1870s, while advancing with the Bessemer and Siemens-Martin processes, was still less controlled than modern methods. \\n\\nFactors like:\\n\\nRaw materials: The quality and purity of iron ore and other ingredients would have varied.\\n\\nProcess control: Temperature control, alloying, and other crucial aspects of steelmaking were less precise than today.\\n\\nHeat treatment: While heat treatment techniques existed, their application and consistency would have been variable. This means that even steel intended for the same purpose could have had a range of properties, including yield strength.\\n\\n\\"Gun Steel\\" was Not a Single Standard: The term \\"gun steel\\" in the 1870s wouldn't have referred to a single, rigidly defined alloy. Different types of guns (cannons, field artillery, rifles, etc.) and different manufacturers might have used slightly different steel compositions and production methods. There wasn't a single international standard for \\"gun steel\\" yield strength.\\n\\nFocus on Other Properties: While yield strength is important, 19th-century gun designers and metallurgists were also very concerned with other properties like:\\n\\nTensile strength: The ultimate strength before breaking.\\n\\nDuctility and toughness: The ability to deform without fracturing, crucial for safety and preventing brittle failures in gun barrels under pressure.\\n\\nResistance to fatigue: Important for guns that would be fired repeatedly.\\n\\nWhat We Can Estimate and General Context:\\n\\nLikely Steel Types: Gun steel in 1870s France would likely have been produced using the newer steelmaking processes (Bessemer or Siemens-Martin) rather than older methods like puddling wrought iron for high-performance guns. This would have been relatively low-carbon steel or mild steel by modern standards. Higher carbon steels were harder to work and could be more brittle.\\n\\nComparison to Modern Mild Steel: Modern mild steel (low carbon steel) typically has a yield strength in the range of 200-250 MPa (Megapascals), and sometimes a bit lower or higher depending on the specific grade and processing.\\n\\nLikely Range for 1870s Gun Steel (Estimate): Given the less refined production techniques of the 1870s, it's reasonable to assume that the yield strength of gun steel at that time might have been in the lower end of the modern mild steel range or slightly below. Perhaps somewhere in the ballpark of 180-250 MPa could be a very rough estimate, and potentially even a bit lower in some cases due to variability.\\nImportant Considerations:\\n\\nThis is an Estimate: It's crucial to understand that this is a broad estimate and not a precise figure. Actual yield strengths would have varied.\\n\\nFocus on Context, Not Precision: When discussing 1870s gun steel, it's more useful to understand the general context – they were using early mass-produced steel which was a significant advancement over previous materials like cast iron and wrought iron, but was still less controlled and potentially less strong than modern steels. The focus was on improving the strength and reliability of guns compared to earlier designs.\\n\\nFurther Research: For more specific information (though it might be very difficult to find), you might need to delve into:\\n\\nHistorical metallurgical texts from the late 19th century (in French).\\n\\nArchival records from French gun manufacturers or military arsenals of that period, if such records exist and are accessible.\\n\\nAcademic research on the history of steel production and military technology in 19th-century France.\\n\\nIn summary, while we can't give a precise average yield strength, understanding the steel production technology of the 1870s suggests that French gun steel of that era likely had a yield strength broadly comparable to, or perhaps slightly lower than, modern mild steel, potentially in the range of 180-250 MPa, but with considerable variability.","edited":false,"gildings":{},"downs":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t1_mcytg3q","is_submitter":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"body_html":"&lt;div class=\\"md\\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;what the average yield strength of gun steel in 1870&amp;#39;s France was&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Here is Gemini&amp;#39;s answer - &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;hr/&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s very difficult to give a precise average yield strength for gun steel in 1870s France.

Yes you can map out what you want to do in your head, e.g. think that you want to start with one thing and end with another for example. But that's just CoT in your mind, that's your internet tokens.

In clinical and neuroscientific contexts, a hallucination is typically defined as a perceptual experience occurring without an external stimulus, yet with a vivid sense of reality.\\n\\nLLMs are probabilistic text generation systems. Full stop. They have been trained on large datasets of text to learn form it statistical patterns of language. \\n\\nWhen asked a question, an LLM doesn’t retrieve facts from a database. Instead, it predicts the most likely next words (tokens) to follow the question based on the patterns it learned. \\n\\nEssentially, it performs a complex form of auto-completion. It looks at the sequence of words so far and uses its learned model to generate a continuation that is statistically plausible.\\n\\nThis process is stochastic. In another words, if you ask the same question multiple times, the model might give slightly different answers depending on random sampling of the next token among high-probability options. \\n\\nThe key point is that an LLM has no direct grounding in external reality. It has no sensory inputs, no awareness of an objective “truth” that it must adhere to. It’s drawing solely on correlations and information embedded in its training data, and on the question given.\\n\\nIt is not a truth machine. It doesn't \\"know\\" facts or grounding truth. It's purpose is NOT to be true. Yes, it is nice to have an LLM that usually generates truth. But if it generates truth, it is only because of the most prominent patterns (that are used in the generation) anciently reflects the truth.\\n\\nUnlike a human brain, which constantly checks perceptions against the external world (our eyes, ears, etc.), an LLM’s entire “world” is just text data.\\n\\nSo, can it hallucinate?

Full stop. They have been trained on large datasets of text to learn form it statistical patterns of language. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When asked a question, an LLM doesn’t retrieve facts from a database. Instead, it predicts the most likely next words (tokens) to follow the question based on the patterns it learned. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Essentially, it performs a complex form of auto-completion. It looks at the sequence of words so far and uses its learned model to generate a continuation that is statistically plausible.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This process is stochastic. In another words, if you ask the same question multiple times, the model might give slightly different answers depending on random sampling of the next token among high-probability options. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The key point is that an LLM has no direct grounding in external reality. It has no sensory inputs, no awareness of an objective “truth” that it must adhere to. It’s drawing solely on correlations and information embedded in its training data, and on the question given.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It is not a truth machine. It doesn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;know&amp;quot; facts or grounding truth. It&amp;#39;s purpose is NOT to be true. Yes, it is nice to have an LLM that usually generates truth. But if it generates truth, it is only because of the most prominent patterns (that are used in the generation) anciently reflects the truth.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Unlike a human brain, which constantly checks perceptions against the external world (our eyes, ears, etc.), an LLM’s entire “world” is just text data.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So, can it hallucinate? No. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10619792/#:%7E:text=,it%20is%20making%20things%20up\\"&gt;https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10619792/#:~:text=,it%20is%20making%20things%20up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;","removal_reason":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"distinguished":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":false,"gildings":{},"unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ipxszq/ridiculous/mcz3mfl/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"report_reasons":null,"created":1739657877,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"link_id":"t3_1ipxszq","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/LocalLLaMA","controversiality":0,"depth":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"mod_reports":[],"num_reports":null,"ups":2}},{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_81eyvm","approved_at_utc":null,"author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"awarders":[],"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"LocalLLaMA","author_flair_template_id":null,"likes":null,"replies":"","user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"md0yqsd","banned_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"SuckDuckTruck","can_mod_post":false,"created_utc":1739682054,"send_replies":true,"parent_id":"t3_1ipxszq","score":2,"author_fullname":"t2_2uaeb3iy","approved_by":null,"mod_note":null,"all_awardings":[],"collapsed":false,"body":"The root cause of the problem is people think LLM's (and AI in general) is some kind of database that should recite with perfect precision any part of anything it received as training input...  \\nIT IS NOT A DATABASE SEARCH ENGINE.\\n\\nSame with stuff like asking an LLM how many R's there are in a strawberry or how many words are in this sentence.  \\nIT IS NOT A WORD PROCESSOR.\\n\\nIt is a very useful tool if you understand what it does, and it is only getting better.","edited":false,"top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t1_md0yqsd","is_submitter":false,"downs":0,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"body_html":"&lt;div class=\\"md\\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The root cause of the problem is people think LLM&amp;#39;s (and AI in general) is some kind of database that should recite with perfect precision any part of anything it received as training input...&lt;br/&gt;\\nIT IS NOT A DATABASE SEARCH ENGINE.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Same with stuff like asking an LLM how many R&amp;#39;s there are in a strawberry or how many words are in this sentence.&lt;br/&gt;\\nIT IS NOT A WORD PROCESSOR.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It is a very useful tool if you understand what it does, and it is only getting better.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;","removal_reason":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"distinguished":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":false,"gildings":{},"unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ipxszq/ridiculous/md0yqsd/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"report_reasons":null,"created":1739682054,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"link_id":"t3_1ipxszq","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/LocalLLaMA","controversiality":0,"depth":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"mod_reports":[],"num_reports":null,"ups":2}},{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_81eyvm","approved_at_utc":null,"author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"awarders":[],"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"LocalLLaMA","author_flair_template_id":null,"likes":null,"replies":{"kind":"Listing","data":{"after":null,"dist":null,"modhash":"","geo_filter":"","children":[{"kind":"t1","data":{"total_awards_received":0,"approved_at_utc":null,"author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"awarders":[],"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"ups":3,"removal_reason":null,"link_id":"t3_1ipxszq","author_flair_template_id":null,"likes":null,"replies":"","user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"mcw6ccj","banned_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"[deleted]","can_mod_post":false,"send_replies":true,"parent_id":"t1_mcvmivw","score":3,"approved_by":null,"report_reasons":null,"all_awardings":[],"subreddit_id":"t5_81eyvm","body":"There is no \\"recall\\" happening.
