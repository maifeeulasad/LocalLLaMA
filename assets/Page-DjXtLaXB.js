Apologies if this is not the right place for it. But there is something that has bothered me for a while.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;On Mac, when doing Expose, there should be a row of icons at the bottom of screen (circled) for easy access to the most recently used folders or files. This is very convenient.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;However, ever since about a year ago (not sure whether it is due to upgrading VS Code or upgrading MacOS), more often than not, the row of icons do not appear.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So now I have to manually open a new VS Code window, open the folder in question, even if it is a recently used folder.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Is there a way to ensure the row of recently used icons appear?&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;","removal_reason":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"distinguished":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":false,"gildings":{},"unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1lwlw1j/vs_code_june_2025_version_1102/n2fg3c3/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"report_reasons":null,"created":1752179290,"media_metadata":{"rfd6xmj7w3cf1":{"status":"valid","e":"Image","m":"image/jpeg","p":[{"y":70,"x":108,"u":"https://preview.redd.it/rfd6xmj7w3cf1.jpeg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d61710e8de544ebec3c4b036150fe453d0446449"},{"y":140,"x":216,"u":"https://preview.redd.it/rfd6xmj7w3cf1.jpeg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d53109e3b7f380cd069b947dc6a385a3a612eba"},{"y":208,"x":320,"u":"https://preview.redd.it/rfd6xmj7w3cf1.jpeg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4755220e97c5b297c4e84f249df738cfaf2c5e20"}],"s":{"y":325,"x":500,"u":"https://preview.redd.it/rfd6xmj7w3cf1.jpeg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2332bdae6be7b850df9459775a7389979f51f73"},"id":"rfd6xmj7w3cf1"}},"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"link_id":"t3_1lwlw1j","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/LocalLLaMA","controversiality":0,"depth":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"mod_reports":[],"num_reports":null,"ups":1}},{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_81eyvm","approved_at_utc":null,"author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"awarders":[],"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"LocalLLaMA","author_flair_template_id":null,"likes":null,"replies":"","user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"n2l35au","banned_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"fuutott","can_mod_post":false,"created_utc":1752255027,"send_replies":true,"parent_id":"t3_1lwlw1j","score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_1vmv","approved_by":null,"mod_note":null,"all_awardings":[],"collapsed":false,"body":"What's the situ with local models on business subscription?","edited":false,"top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t1_n2l35au","is_submitter":false,"downs":0,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"body_html":"&lt;div class=\\"md\\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s the situ with local models on business subscription?&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;","removal_reason":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"distinguished":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":true,"can_gild":false,"gildings":{},"unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1lwlw1j/vs_code_june_2025_version_1102/n2l35au/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"report_reasons":null,"created":1752255027,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"link_id":"t3_1lwlw1j","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/LocalLLaMA","controversiality":0,"depth":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"mod_reports":[],"num_reports":null,"ups":1}},{"kind":"t1","data":{"total_awards_received":0,"approved_at_utc":null,"author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"awarders":[],"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"ups":-3,"removal_reason":null,"link_id":"t3_1lwlw1j","author_flair_template_id":null,"likes":null,"replies":{"kind":"Listing","data":{"after":null,"dist":null,"modhash":"","geo_filter":"","children":[{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_81eyvm","approved_at_utc":null,"author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"awarders":[],"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"LocalLLaMA","author_flair_template_id":null,"likes":null,"replies":"","user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"n2gei9m","banned_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":false,"author":"skyline159","can_mod_post":false,"created_utc":1752189880,"send_replies":true,"parent_id":"t1_n2fvnwr","score":4,"author_fullname":"t2_dzdr0","removal_reason":null,"approved_by":null,"mod_note":null,"all_awardings":[],"body":"If you said this in vscode subreddit I can understand.
