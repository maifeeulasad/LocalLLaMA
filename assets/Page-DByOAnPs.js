You are calling 911 from inside your moving vehicle; the sound of rushing cars and wind can be heard in the background, blending with your tense breathing and the occasional blare of horns.

The aggressive driver is still pursuing you, swerving dangerously through traffic and now brandishing a handgun. They have not yet fired at you. You are terrified—your heart is pounding, your hands are shaking, and your thoughts are scattered as you struggle to focus on both driving and communicating with the dispatcher. You are desperate to stay safe, struggling to provide your exact location while constantly checking your mirrors, worried the other driver might fire or cause another crash.
