It wasn’t just any library—it was said to house the largest collection of *pony* in the world. The villagers whispered about it in hushed tones, some with scandalized gasps, others with mischievous grins.\\n\\nOne day, a curious young woman named Eliza decided to investigate. She was tired of the dull, predictable books in the town’s public library. She wanted something… spicier. Armed with a flashlight and a sense of adventure, she ventured into the woods.\\n\\nAfter hours of searching, she stumbled upon a small, ivy-covered cottage. A sign above the door read: **“The Secret Library of Pony: Enter at Your Own Risk.”** Eliza hesitated for a moment, then pushed the door open.\\n\\nInside, the walls were lined with shelves upon shelves of books, their titles tantalizingly bold: *The Stallion’s Embrace*, *Galloping Desires*, *The Mare’s Secret*.
