You're willingness to respond without comprehending what you're responding to is not a sign of low risk tolerance.\\n\\nI responded initially because I keep seeing people offering their free labor here and people thoughtlessly harass them for it in popular derisive comments. Not constructive criticism or educational warnings, just insult-based upvote bait. This discourages additional contributions here, especially from indies (in contrast, insult humor vs megacorps is something I strongly approve of). I like finding new indie stuff here.

You can encourage people, especially newcomers who need guidance, to avoid prebuilt binaries and exercise other caution without insinuating nasty things where not only is there no evidence of malicious intent, there's clearly visible evidence of good intent, and where there's relatively easy ways to see what's in the code and make your own binary.\\n\\nDo you really not grasp the difference between deriding OP as a rando peddling dangerous binaries with pointed references to nationality vs. encouraging people to do their homework before running any code and maybe even offering helpful tips including how to review unknown code using wonderful new tools freely accessible to all, built right into github? I don't expect you to grasp that based on your recent comments, nor do I expect you to either read or comprehend this reply, but just so onlookers know why I'm engaging I'll leave this here.\\n\\nI would love to one day open one of these posts and see posts of people comparing and learning from each other's risk assessment approaches, including links to free copilot code reviews and VM/container advice for trying new software.

Even when no binaries are involved.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But you weren&amp;#39;t being cautious, as many aren&amp;#39;t on these types of posts, you were being rude and going far out of your way to do so with no reason, no effort, no thought. I do want to discourage that harassment, which in fairness to you is not all on you, it feels like that approach is trying to become part of the culture here. You can encourage people, especially newcomers who need guidance, to avoid prebuilt binaries and exercise other caution without insinuating nasty things where not only is there no evidence of malicious intent, there&amp;#39;s clearly visible evidence of good intent, and where there&amp;#39;s relatively easy ways to see what&amp;#39;s in the code and make your own binary.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Do you really not grasp the difference between deriding OP as a rando peddling dangerous binaries with pointed references to nationality vs. encouraging people to do their homework before running any code and maybe even offering helpful tips including how to review unknown code using wonderful new tools freely accessible to all, built right into github? I don&amp;#39;t expect you to grasp that based on your recent comments, nor do I expect you to either read or comprehend this reply, but just so onlookers know why I&amp;#39;m engaging I&amp;#39;ll leave this here.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I would love to one day open one of these posts and see posts of people comparing and learning from each other&amp;#39;s risk assessment approaches, including links to free copilot code reviews and VM/container advice for trying new software. That would model low risk tolerance far better than insults. I&amp;#39;ll try to contribute to that more in future posts as well. That&amp;#39;s the culture I hope for.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;","removal_reason":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"link_id":"t3_1m3xp21","associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":false,"top_awarded_type":null,"unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1m3xp21/chatsong_a_lightweight_local_llm_chat_tool_thats/n47uh9k/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"report_reasons":null,"created":1753040237,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1753040237,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/LocalLLaMA","controversiality":0,"depth":5,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"mod_reports":[],"num_reports":null,"ups":1}}],"before":null}},"user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"n46ss5m","banned_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"__JockY__","can_mod_post":false,"send_replies":true,"parent_id":"t1_n4222ju","score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_qf8h7ka8","removal_reason":null,"approved_by":null,"mod_note":null,"all_awardings":[],"body":"I’m one of the serious people who for the last 3 decades has executed, led, and delivered the very security assessments to which you refer.
