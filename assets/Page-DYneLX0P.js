In the meantime I got a OnePlus 13 with 16GB of RAM. After tinkering with different models and apps for half a day, I figured I give my feedback for the people who are interested in this specific scenario. \\n\\nI'm used to running 32B models on my PC and after many (subjective) tests I realized that modern 14B models are not far behind in capabilities, at least for my use-cases. I find 8B models kinda meh (I'm warming up to them lately), but my obsession was to be able to run 14B models on a phone, so here we are. \\n\\n**Key Points:**  \\nQwen3 14B loaded via MNN Chat runs decent, but the performance is not consistent. You can expect anywhere from 4.5-7 tokens per second, but the overall performance is around 5.5t/s. I don't know exactly what quantization this models uses because MNN Chat doesn't say it. My guess, based on the file size, is that it's either Q4\\\\_K\\\\_S or IQ4. Could also be Q4\\\\_K\\\\_M but the file seems rather small for that so I have my doubts. \\n\\nQwen3 8B runs at around 8 tokens per second, but again I don't know what quantization. Based on the file size, I'm guessing it's Q6\\\\_K\\\\_M. I was kinda expecting a bit more here, but whatever. 8t/s is around reading/thinking speed for me, so I'm ok with that. \\n\\nI also used PocketPal to run some abliterated versions of Qwen3 14B at Q4\\\\_K\\\\_M. Performance was similar to MNN Chat which surprised me since everyone was saying that MNN Chat should provide a significant boost in performance since it's optimized to work with Snapdragon NPUs. Maybe at this model size the VRAM bandwidth is the bottleneck so the performance improvements are not obvious anymore. \\n\\nEnabling or disabling thinking doesn't seem to affect the speed directly, but it will affect it indirectly. More on that later. \\n\\nI'm in the process of downloading Qwen3-30B-A3B. By all acounts it should not fit in VRAM, but OnePlus has that virtual memory thing that allows you to expand the RAM by an extra 12GB. It will use the UFS storage obviously. ~~This should put me at 16+12=28GB of RAM which should allow me to load the model.~~ LE: never mind. The version provided by MNN Chat doesn't load. I think it's meant for phones with 24GB RAM and the extra 12GB swap file doesn't seem to trick it. Will try to load an IQ2 quant via PocketPal and report back. Downloading as we speak. If that one doesn't work, it's gonna have to be IQ1\\\\_XSS, but other users have already reported on that, so I'm not gonna do it again. \\n\\n  \\n**IMPORTANT:**  \\nThe performance WILL drop the more you talk and the the more you fill up the context. Both the prompt processing speed as well as the token generation speed will take a hit. At some point you will not be able to continue the conversation, not because the token generation speed drops so much, but because the prompt processing speed is too slow and it takes ages to read the entire context before it responds. The token generation speed drops linearly, but the prompt processing speed seems to drop exponentially. \\n\\nWhat that means is that realistically, when you're running a 14B model on your phone, if you enable thinking, you'll be able to ask it about 2 or 3 questions before the prompt processing speed becomes so slow that you'll prefer to start a new chat. With thinking disabled you'll get 4-5 questions before it becomes annoyingly slow. Again, the token generation speed doesn't drop that much. It goes from 5.5t/s to 4.5t/s, so the AI still answers reasonably fast. The problem is that you will wait ages until it starts answering. \\n\\nPS: phones with 12GB RAM will not be able to run 14B models because Android is a slut for RAM and takes up a lot. 16GB is minimum for 14B, and 24GB is recommended for peace of mind. I got the 16GB version because I just couldn't justify the extra price for the 24GB model and also because it's almost unobtanium and it involved buying it from another country and waiting ages. If you can find a 24GB version for a decent price, go for that. If not, 16GB is also fine. Keep in mind that the issue with the prompt proccessing speed is NOT solved with extra RAM. You'll still only be able to get 2-3 questions in with thinking and 4-5 no\\\\_think before it turns into a snail.
