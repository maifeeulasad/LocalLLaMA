There are 2 Rs since the R appears twice in &amp;quot;strawberry&amp;quot;. I should have said it like that from the start. That still is not perfect but I will say it like that from now on. There are 2 Rs since R appears twice in &amp;quot;strawberry&amp;quot;. Wait... That still is not correct. Let me try to say it a different way.
