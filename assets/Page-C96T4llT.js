I have a child that has reading difficulties. They need to be able to read 15 books this coming year and I was lucky enough to be able to find out what those 15 books are. Many of them are from the 1920s and earlier. They’re relatively unpopular and do not have existing audiobooks available. A number of them aren’t even sold as Ebooks (yes we are all aghast).

So I used my colleagues audiobook generator with my local rig. Each book gets chunked into around 1500 to 2000 chunks. My initial recording was on AirPods and/or a local microphone inside my MacBook.

With those recordings (I had two different ones) I had a 35 to 40% error rate which often persisted even when I was trying to generate 10 attempts. 

I happened to pick up a prosumer voice recorder to be able to do interviews with older relatives as an audio genealogical history. When I recorded my voice with those reading the exact same script as the other two recordings I went to a 5 to 10% air rate with three shots. Mostly closer to 5% but sometimes up to 10% 

For everyone who is having issues with their voice recording cloning, you may want to consider the quality of your microphone. I would have assumed that for an expressive reading of an audiobook it would be fine to just use decent quality hardware microphones. I was shocked at the improvement levels in the transcription passes and the output. It’s relatively obvious after I say it out loud, but I don’t see many people talking about it (too basic for the experts in the space and not something that the novices immediately intuit perhaps) so I thought I’d share.`,user_reports:[],saved:!1,mod_reason_title:null,gilded:0,clicked:!1,title:"Chatterbox tts microphone results",link_flair_richtext:[{e:"text",t:"Discussion"}],subreddit_name_prefixed:"r/LocalLLaMA",hidden:!1,pwls:6,link_flair_css_class:"",downs:0,thumbnail_height:null,top_awarded_type:null,hide_score:!1,name:"t3_1m5lf6l",quarantine:!1,link_flair_text_color:"light",upvote_ratio:.88,author_flair_background_color:null,subreddit_type:"public",ups:6,total_awards_received:0,media_embed:{},thumbnail_width:null,author_flair_template_id:null,is_original_content:!1,author_fullname:"t2_i6kuh6b9",secure_media:null,is_reddit_media_domain:!1,is_meta:!1,category:null,secure_media_embed:{},link_flair_text:"Discussion",can_mod_post:!1,score:6,approved_by:null,is_created_from_ads_ui:!1,author_premium:!1,thumbnail:"self",edited:!1,author_flair_css_class:null,author_flair_richtext:[],gildings:{},content_categories:null,is_self:!0,mod_note:null,created:1753110478,link_flair_type:"richtext",wls:6,removed_by_category:null,banned_by:null,author_flair_type:"text",domain:"self.LocalLLaMA",allow_live_comments:!1,selftext_html:`&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;;tldr when voice cloning use a high-end microphone not the one built-in to your computer/airpods&lt;/p&gt;
