Using a commercial service, you usually have to provide it with your documents (which is very limited) or use the *entire internet* as the RAG database (eg, Google Web Search AI Overview, or OpenAI Deep Research) which is not great because the internet's average content quality is low, and it contains loads of counterfactual content too.  These factors limit the competence of commercial inference services.\\n\\nRegarding \\"Guided Generation\\", llama.cpp had \\"grammars\\" about a year before OpenAI came out with their equivalent \\"schemas\\" feature, which is a lot harder to use than grammars.  This means we have a much easier time guiding inference in the directions we want, like forcing it to use a specific language or structured output format (JSON, XML, etc).  We will probably get other Guided Generation features long before the commercial services do (though they will catch up of course).\\n\\nIt's also worth pointing out that we \\"GPU Poor\\" are getting less and less poor all the time.  We will never have the GPU power of the commercial services, but they are bumping up against the limits of hardware scaling already, while we are not.
