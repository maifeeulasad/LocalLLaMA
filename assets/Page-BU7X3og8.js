The hope on their end is that they become the standard solution and then can charge people for some premium version or SAAS solution.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;","gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"distinguished":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":false,"link_id":"t3_1lu5g8c","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1lu5g8c/thanks_to_you_i_built_an_opensource_website_that/n1wsxdy/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"report_reasons":null,"created":1751938733,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1751938733,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/LocalLLaMA","controversiality":0,"depth":2,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"mod_reports":[],"num_reports":null,"ups":3}}],"before":null}},"user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"n1wbspf","banned_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":false,"author":"chickenofthewoods","can_mod_post":false,"created_utc":1751932865,"send_replies":true,"parent_id":"t1_n1w6n2q","score":6,"author_fullname":"t2_33uo4","removal_reason":null,"approved_by":null,"mod_note":null,"all_awardings":[],"body":"What's the beef?  sincere question.","edited":false,"top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t1_n1wbspf","is_submitter":false,"downs":0,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"body_html":"&lt;div class=\\"md\\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s the beef?  sincere question.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;","gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"distinguished":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":false,"link_id":"t3_1lu5g8c","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1lu5g8c/thanks_to_you_i_built_an_opensource_website_that/n1wbspf/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"report_reasons":null,"created":1751932865,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"collapsed":false,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/LocalLLaMA","controversiality":0,"depth":1,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"mod_reports":[],"num_reports":null,"ups":6}},{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_81eyvm","approved_at_utc":null,"author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"awarders":[],"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"LocalLLaMA","author_flair_template_id":null,"likes":null,"replies":"","user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"n1x08hv","banned_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":false,"author":"__JockY__","can_mod_post":false,"created_utc":1751941251,"send_replies":true,"parent_id":"t1_n1w6n2q","score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_qf8h7ka8","removal_reason":null,"approved_by":null,"mod_note":null,"all_awardings":[],"body":"I mean...
