I'm doing research on the automation market — especially automation for small businesses, repetitive tasks, integrations with systems, bots, among other things. I want to better understand two specific pains:

1. For those who want to sell automations (freelancers, agencies, devs, etc.):
 – What has made it difficult to close customers?
 – Where do you find (or miss) opportunities?
 – What does the customer generally not understand or value?
 – How do you validate that automation makes sense for the client’s business?


2. For those who want to hire someone to automate things:
 – What is the biggest difficulty in finding someone trustworthy?
 – What makes you trust (or distrust) those who offer the service?
 – Where do you usually look for this type of professional?



The idea is to understand the pain on both sides — those who sell and those who hire — to come up with a more practical and useful solution. Any experience you have (good or bad) helps a lot!

It would be really appreciated if you could share 🙏`,user_reports:[],saved:!1,mod_reason_title:null,gilded:0,clicked:!1,title:"What are the biggest challenges in selling automations (and finding someone to implement them)?
