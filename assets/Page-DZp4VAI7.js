Recently vulkan support on amd cards has improved a lot, so this option now makes even more sense than before.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Carefully divide the layers between all cards - leaving a reserve of about 1GB. The downside is that processing with many cards on vulkan is not so great - compared to CUDA or ROCM. Additionally, put as few layers as possible on the slowest card - it will slow down the rest (although it will still work much faster than the CPU).&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\\"https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/discussions/10879\\"&gt;https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/discussions/10879&lt;/a&gt; This will give you a better idea of ​​what to expect from certain cards.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;","removal_reason":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"distinguished":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":false,"gildings":{},"unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ls7vmb/multi_gpus/n1gfel8/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"report_reasons":null,"created":1751715853,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"link_id":"t3_1ls7vmb","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/LocalLLaMA","controversiality":0,"depth":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"mod_reports":[],"num_reports":null,"ups":1}},{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_81eyvm","approved_at_utc":null,"author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"awarders":[],"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"LocalLLaMA","author_flair_template_id":null,"likes":null,"replies":{"kind":"Listing","data":{"after":null,"dist":null,"modhash":"","geo_filter":"","children":[{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_81eyvm","approved_at_utc":null,"author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"awarders":[],"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"LocalLLaMA","author_flair_template_id":null,"likes":null,"replies":{"kind":"Listing","data":{"after":null,"dist":null,"modhash":"","geo_filter":"","children":[{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_81eyvm","approved_at_utc":null,"author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"awarders":[],"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"LocalLLaMA","author_flair_template_id":null,"likes":null,"replies":"","user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"n1gjraf","banned_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"AppearanceHeavy6724","can_mod_post":false,"send_replies":true,"parent_id":"t1_n1ghdp8","score":0,"author_fullname":"t2_uz37qfx5","removal_reason":null,"approved_by":null,"mod_note":null,"all_awardings":[],"body":"&gt; I never heard of p series, is this GPU intended for what?\\n\\nmining.\\n\\n&gt; Two of these would be worth it?\\n\\nprobably not, but a single one is a great combo for 3060 12 GiB or even 5060ti 16 GiB.","edited":false,"top_awarded_type":null,"downs":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t1_n1gjraf","is_submitter":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"body_html":"&lt;div class=\\"md\\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;I never heard of p series, is this GPU intended for what?&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;mining.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Two of these would be worth it?&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;probably not, but a single one is a great combo for 3060 12 GiB or even 5060ti 16 GiB.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;","gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"distinguished":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":false,"link_id":"t3_1ls7vmb","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ls7vmb/multi_gpus/n1gjraf/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"report_reasons":null,"created":1751717917,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1751717917,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/LocalLLaMA","controversiality":0,"depth":2,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"mod_reports":[],"num_reports":null,"ups":0}}],"before":null}},"user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"n1ghdp8","banned_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"WEREWOLF_BX13","can_mod_post":false,"created_utc":1751716805,"send_replies":true,"parent_id":"t1_n1gggn8","score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_eljq22kg","removal_reason":null,"approved_by":null,"mod_note":null,"all_awardings":[],"body":"They got me a little confused, so I made a little more specific question just to know, apologies 👤\\n\\n\\nI never heard of p series, is this GPU intended for what?
