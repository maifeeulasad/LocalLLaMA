The former director of Noah's Ark was Yao Jun (whom everyone called Teacher Yao). Several lab directors include: Tang Ruiming (Ming-ge, Team Ming, has since left), Shang Lifeng, Zhang Wei (Wei-ge), Hao Jianye (Teacher Hao), and Liu Wulong (referred to as Director Wulong). Many other key members and experts have also left one after another.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe belong to an organization called the \\"Fourth Field Army\\" (四野). Under the Fourth Field Army, there are many \\"columns\\" (纵队); the foundational language model team is the Fourth Column. Wang Yunhe's small model team is the Sixteenth Column. We participated in gatherings in Suzhou, with various monthly deadlines. During the \\"problem-tackling sessions\\" in Suzhou, \\"mission orders\\" were issued, requiring us to meet targets before set deadlines. The Suzhou gatherings brought people from all over to the Suzhou Research Institute. We usually stayed in hotels, such as one in Lu Zhi (甪直), separated from our families and children.\\n\\n\\n\\nDuring the Suzhou gatherings, Saturday was a default workday. It was exhausting, but there was afternoon tea on Saturdays, and one time we even had crayfish. Our workstations at the Suzhou Research Institute were moved once, from one building to another. The buildings at the Suzhou Institute have European-style architecture, with a large slope at the entrance, and the scenery inside is beautiful. Trips to the Suzhou gatherings would last at least a week, sometimes longer. Many people couldn't go home for one or even two months.\\n\\n\\n\\nNoah's Ark was once rumored to be research-oriented, but after I joined, because we were working on the large model project under the Fourth Field Army, the project members completely turned into a delivery-focused team, swamped with routine meetings, reviews, and reports. We often had to apply just to run experiments. The team needed to interface with numerous business lines like Terminal's Celia (小艺), Huawei Cloud, and ICT, and the delivery pressure was immense.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Pangu model developed by Noah's Ark was initially codenamed \\"Pangu Zhizi\\" (盘古智子). At first, it was only available as an internal webpage that required an application for trial use. Later, due to pressure, it was integrated into Welink and opened for public beta.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe recent controversy surrounding the accusations that the Pangu LLM plagiarized Qwen has been all over the news. As a member of the Pangu team, I've been tossing and turning every night, unable to sleep. Pangu's brand has been so severely damaged. On one hand, I selfishly worry about my own career development and feel that my past hard work was for nothing. On the other hand, I feel a sense of vindication now that someone has started exposing these things. For countless days and nights, we gritted our teeth in anger, powerless, as certain individuals internally reaped endless benefits through repeated fraud. This suppression and humiliation have gradually eroded my affection for Huawei, leaving me dazed and confused, lost and aimless, often questioning my life and self-worth.\\n\\n\\n\\nI admit that I am a coward. As a humble worker, I dare not oppose people like Wang Yunhe with their powerful connections, let alone a behemoth like Huawei. I am terrified of losing my job, as I have a family and children to support. That's why I deeply admire the whistleblower from the bottom of my heart. However, when I see the internal attempts to whitewash and cover up the facts to deceive the public, I can no longer tolerate it. I want to be brave for once and follow my conscience. Even if I harm myself by 800, I hope to damage the enemy by 1,000. I have decided to publicize what I have seen and heard here (some of which is from colleagues) about the \\"legendary story\\" of the Pangu LLM.\\n\\n\\n\\nHuawei has indeed primarily trained its large models on Ascend cards (the Small Model Lab has quite a few Nvidia cards, which they used for training before transitioning to Ascend). I was once captivated by Huawei's determination to \\"build the world's second choice,\\" and I used to have deep feelings for the company. We went through trials and tribulations with Ascend, from being full of bugs to now being able to train models, and we invested immense effort and sacrifice.\\n\\n\\n\\nInitially, our computing power was very limited, and we trained models on the 910A. At that time, it only supported fp16, and the training stability was far worse than bf16. Pangu started working on MoE (Mixture of Experts) very early. In 2023, the main focus was on training a 38B MoE model and a subsequent 71B dense model. The 71B dense model was expanded to become the first-generation 135B dense model, and later, the main models were gradually trained on the 910B.\\n\\n\\n\\nBoth the 71B and 135B models had a huge, fundamental flaw: the tokenizer. The tokenizer used back then had extremely low encoding efficiency. Every single symbol, number, space, and even Chinese character took up one token. As you can imagine, this wasted a tremendous amount of computing power and resulted in poor model performance. At that time, the Small Model Lab happened to have a vocabulary they had trained themselves. Teacher Yao suspected that the model's tokenizer was the problem (and in hindsight, his suspicion was undoubtedly correct). So, he decided to have the 71B and 135B models switch tokenizers, as the Small Model Lab had experimented with this before. The team stitched together two tokenizers and began the replacement process. The replacement for the 71B model failed. The 135B model, using a more refined embedding initialization strategy, finally succeeded in changing its vocabulary after being continually trained on at least 1T of data. But as you can imagine, the performance did not improve.\\n\\n\\n\\nMeanwhile, other domestic companies like Alibaba and Zhipu AI were training on GPUs and had already figured out the right methods. The gap between Pangu and its competitors grew wider and wider. An internal 230B dense model, trained from scratch, failed for various reasons, pushing the project to the brink of collapse. Facing pressure from several deadlines and strong internal skepticism about Pangu, the team's morale hit rock bottom. With extremely limited computing power, the team struggled and tried many things. For example, they accidentally discovered that the 38B MoE model at the time did not have the expected MoE effect. So they removed the MoE parameters, reverting it to a 13B dense model. Since the 38B MoE originated from a very early Pangu Alpha 13B with a relatively outdated architecture, the team made a series of changes, such as switching from absolute position encoding to RoPE, removing bias, and switching to RMSNorm. Given the failures with the tokenizer and the experience of changing vocabularies, this model's vocabulary was also replaced with the one used by Wang Yunhe's Small Model Lab's 7B model. This 13B model was later expanded and continually trained, becoming the second-generation 38B dense model (which was the main mid-range Pangu model for several months) and was once quite competitive. However, because the larger 135B model had an outdated architecture and was severely damaged by the vocabulary change (later analysis revealed that the stitched-together vocabulary had even more serious bugs), its performance after continued training still lagged far behind leading domestic models like Qwen. The internal criticism and pressure from leadership grew even stronger. The team was practically in a desperate situation.\\n\\n\\n\\nUnder these circumstances, Wang Yunhe and his Small Model Lab stepped in. They claimed to have inherited and modified the parameters from the old 135B model, and by training on just a few hundred billion tokens, they improved various metrics by an average of about ten points. In reality, this was their first masterpiece of \\"shell-wrapping\\" (套壳, i.e., putting a new shell on another company's model) applied to a large model. At Huawei, laymen lead experts, so the leadership had no concept of how absurd this was; they just thought there must be some algorithmic innovation. After internal analysis, it was discovered that they had actually continued training on Qwen 1.5 110B, adding layers, expanding the FFN dimensions, and incorporating some mechanisms from the Pangu-Pi paper to reach about 135B parameters. In fact, the old 135B had 107 layers, while this new model only had 82, and various other configurations were different. After training, the distribution of many parameters in the new, mysterious 135B model was almost identical to Qwen 110B. Even the class name in the model's code was \\"Qwen\\" at the time; they were too lazy to even change it. This model later became the so-called 135B V2. And this model was provided to many downstream teams, including external customers.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis incident was a huge blow to those of us colleagues who were doing our work seriously and honestly. Many people internally, including those in the Terminal and Huawei Cloud divisions, knew about this. We all joked that we should stop calling it the Pangu model and call it the \\"Qiangu\\" model instead (a pun combining Qwen and Pangu). At the time, team members wanted to report this to the BCG (Business Conduct Guidelines) office, as it was major business fraud. But later, it was said that a leader stopped them, because higher-level leaders (like Teacher Yao, and possibly Director Xiong and Elder Zha) also found out later but did nothing about it. Getting good results through shell-wrapping was also beneficial to them. This event caused several of the team's strongest members to become disheartened, and talk of resignation became commonplace.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt this point, Pangu seemed to find a turning point. Since the Pangu models mentioned earlier were mostly based on continued training and modification, Noah's Ark at that time had no grasp of training technology from scratch, let alone on Ascend's NPUs. Thanks to the strenuous efforts of the team's core members, Pangu began training its third-generation models. After immense effort, the data architecture and training algorithms gradually caught up with the industry. The people from the Small Model Lab had nothing to do with this hardship.\\n\\n\\n\\nInitially, the team members had no confidence and started with just a 13B model. But later, they found the results were quite good. So this model was later expanded again, becoming the third-generation 38B, codenamed 38B V3. I'm sure many brothers in the product lines are familiar with this model. At that time, this model's tokenizer was an extension of Llama's vocabulary (a common practice in the industry). Meanwhile, Wang Yunhe's lab created another vocabulary (which later became the vocabulary for the Pangu series). The two vocabularies were forced into a \\"horse race\\" (a competitive trial), which ended with no clear winner. So, the leadership immediately decided that the vocabularies should be unified, and Wang Yunhe's should be used. Consequently, the 135B V3 (known externally as Pangu Ultra), which was trained from scratch, adopted this tokenizer. This also explains the confusion many brothers who used our models had: why two models of the same V3 generation, but different sizes, used different tokenizers.\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom the bottom of our hearts, we feel that the 135B V3 was the pride of our Fourth Column team at the time. It was the first truly full-stack, self-developed, properly from-scratch-trained, hundred-billion-parameter-level model from Huawei, and its performance was comparable to competitors in early 2024. Writing this, I am already in tears. It was so incredibly difficult. To ensure stable training, the team conducted a large number of comparative experiments and performed timely rollbacks and restarts whenever the model's gradients showed anomalies. This model truly achieved what was later stated in the technical report: not a single loss spike throughout the entire training process. We overcame countless difficulties. We did it. We are willing to guarantee the authenticity of this model's training with our lives and honor. How many sleepless nights did we spend for its training? How wronged and aggrieved did we feel when we were being worthless in internal forums? We persevered.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe are the ones who were truly burning our youth to build up China's domestic computing foundation... Away from home, we gave up our families, our holidays, our health, and our entertainment. We risked everything. The hardships and difficulties involved cannot be fully described in a few words. At various mobilization meetings, when we shouted slogans like \\"Pangu will prevail, Huawei will prevail,\\" we were genuinely and deeply moved.\\n\\n\\n\\nHowever, all the fruits of our hard work were often casually taken by the Small Model Lab. Data? They just demanded it. Code? They just took it and even required us to help adapt it so it could be run with a single click. We used to joke that the Small Model Lab was the \\"mouse-clicking lab.\\" We did the hard work; they reaped the glory. It really is true what they say: \\"You are carrying a heavy burden so that someone else can live a peaceful life.\\" Under these circumstances, more and more of our comrades could no longer hold on and chose to leave. Seeing those brilliant colleagues leave one by one, I felt both regret and sadness. In this battle-like environment, we were more like comrades-in-arms than colleagues. They were also great teachers from whom I could learn countless technical things. Seeing them go to outstanding teams like ByteDance's Seed, Deepseek, Moonshot AI, Tencent, and Kuaishou, I am genuinely happy for them and wish them the best for escaping this exhausting and dirty place. I still vividly remember what a colleague who left said: \\"Coming here was a disgrace to my technical career. Every day I stay here is a waste of life.\\" The words were harsh, but they left me speechless. I worried about my own lack of technical expertise and my inability to adapt to the high-turnover environment of internet companies, which kept me from taking the step to resign despite thinking about it many times.\\n\\n\\n\\nBesides dense models, Pangu later began exploring MoE models. Initially, a 224B MoE model was trained. In parallel, the Small Model Lab launched its second major shell-wrapping operation (minor incidents may have included other models, like a math model), which is the now infamous Pangu-Pro MoE 72B. This model was internally claimed to have been expanded from the Small Model Lab's 7B model (even if true, this contradicts the technical report, let alone the fact that it was continued training on a shell of Qwen 2.5's 14B). I remember that just a few days after they started training, their internal evaluation scores immediately caught up with our 38B V3 at the time. Many brothers in the AI System Lab knew about their shell-wrapping operation because they needed to adapt the model, but for various reasons, they couldn't bring justice to light. In fact, for this model that was trained for a very long time afterward, I am surprised that HonestAGI was able to detect this level of similarity. The computing power spent on \\"washing\\" the parameters to continue training would have been more than enough to train a model of the same size from scratch. I heard from colleagues that they used many methods to wash away Qwen's watermark, even intentionally training it on dirty data. This provides an unprecedented case study for the academic community researching model \\"lineage.\\" New lineage detection methods in the future can be tested on this.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn late 2024 and early 2025, after the release of Deepseek v3 and r1, our team was hit hard by their stunning technical level and faced even greater skepticism. To keep up with the trend, Pangu imitated Deepseek's model size and began training a 718B MoE model. At this time, the Small Model Lab struck again. They chose to shell-wrap and continue training on Deepseek-v3. They trained the model by freezing the parameters loaded from Deepseek. Even the directory for loading the checkpoint was named deepseekv3—they didn't even bother to change it. How arrogant is that? In contrast, some colleagues with true technical integrity were training another 718B MoE from scratch, but they encountered all sorts of problems. But obviously, how could this model ever be better than a direct shell-wrap? If it weren't for the team leader's insistence, it would have been shut down long ago.\\n\\n\\n\\nHuawei's cumbersome process management severely slows down the R&amp;D pace of large models, with things like version control, model lineage, various procedures, and traceability requirements. Ironically, the Small Model Lab's models never seem to be bound by these processes. They can shell-wrap whenever they want, continue training whenever they want, and endlessly demand computing resources. This stark, almost surreal contrast illustrates the current state of process management: \\"The magistrates are allowed to set fires, but the common people are not even allowed to light lamps.\\" How ridiculous? How tragic? How hateful? How shameful!\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter the HonestAGI incident, we were forced into endless internal discussions and analyses on how to handle public relations and \\"respond.\\" Admittedly, the original analysis might not have been strong enough, giving Wang Yunhe and the Small Model Lab an opportunity to argue and twist the truth. For this, I have felt sick to my stomach these past two days, constantly questioning the meaning of my life and whether there is any justice in the world. I'm not playing along anymore. I'm going to resign. I am also applying to have my name removed from the author list of some of the Pangu technical reports. Having my name on those reports is a stain on my life that I can never erase. At the time, I never thought they would be brazen enough to open-source it. I never thought they would dare to fool the world like this and promote it so heavily. At that time, perhaps I was holding onto a sliver of wishful thinking and didn't refuse to be listed as an author. I believe many of my dedicated comrades were also forced onto this pirate ship or were unaware of the situation. But this can't be undone. I hope to spend the rest of my life doing solid, meaningful work to atone for my weakness and indecisiveness back then.\\n\\n\\n\\nWriting this late at night, I am already in tears, sobbing uncontrollably. I remember when some outstanding colleagues were leaving, I asked them with a wry smile if they were going to post a long, customary farewell message on the internal forum to expose the situation. They replied, \\"No, it's a waste of time, and I'm afraid it would make things even worse for you all.\\" At that moment, I felt a deep sense of sorrow, because my comrades, with whom I had once fought for a common ideal, had completely lost faith in Huawei. We used to joke that we were using the Communist Party's \\"millet plus rifles\\" (meager resources) while the organization had the style of the Kuomintang (corrupt and bureaucratic).\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was a time when I was proud that we were using \\"millet plus rifles\\" to defeat foreign guns and cannons.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, I am tired. I want to surrender.\\n\\n\\n\\nTo this day, I still sincerely hope that Huawei can learn its lesson, do Pangu right, make Pangu world-class, and bring Ascend to the level of Nvidia. The internal phenomenon of \\"bad money driving out good\\" has caused Noah's Ark, and even Huawei, to rapidly lose a large number of outstanding large model talents. I believe they are now shining in various teams like Deepseek, realizing their ambitions and talents, and contributing to the fierce AI competition between China and the US. I often lament that Huawei doesn't lack talent; it simply doesn't know how to retain it. If these people were given the right environment, the right resources, fewer shackles, and less political infighting, what would stop Pangu from succeeding?\\n\\n\\n\\nFinally: I swear on my life, character, and honor that everything I have written above is true (at least within my limited knowledge). I do not have the high level of technical skill or the opportunity to conduct a thorough and solid analysis, nor do I dare to use internal records as direct evidence for fear of being caught through information security. But I believe many of my former comrades will vouch for me. To my brothers still inside Huawei, including those in the product lines we served, I believe the countless details in this article will resonate with your own impressions and corroborate my claims. You too may have been deceived, but these cruel truths will not remain buried. The traces of our struggle should not be distorted and buried either.\\n\\n\\n\\nHaving written so much, certain people will surely want to find me and silence me. The company might even try to shut me up or hold me accountable. If that happens, my personal safety, and even that of my family, could be threatened. For my own protection, I will report that I am safe to everyone daily in the near future.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf I disappear, just consider it my sacrifice for truth and ideals, for the better development of computing power and AI in Huawei and even in China. I am willing to be buried in that place where I once fought.\\n\\n\\n\\nGoodbye, Noah's Ark.\\n\\n\\n\\nWritten in the early morning of July 6, 2024, in Shenzhen.","user_reports":[],"saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"Huawei's Pangu AI Rocked by Unverified Claims of Fraud from Alleged Team Member","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Discussion"}],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/LocalLLaMA","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":false,"name":"t3_1lsz4hk","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"light","upvote_ratio":0.95,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":299,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"author_fullname":"t2_tueeshp7","secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Discussion","can_mod_post":false,"score":299,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":1751802437,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"post_hint":"self","content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1751801803,"link_flair_type":"richtext","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.LocalLLaMA","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\\"md\\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\\"https://github.com/HW-whistleblower/True-Story-of-Pangu\\"&gt;https://github.com/HW-whistleblower/True-Story-of-Pangu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\\nafter reading the traslation of this article, I found there&amp;#39;re many details, is it possible true or just a fake story?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;gemini&amp;#39;s traslation:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This is a full translation of the provided text.

Given the failures with the tokenizer and the experience of changing vocabularies, this model&amp;#39;s vocabulary was also replaced with the one used by Wang Yunhe&amp;#39;s Small Model Lab&amp;#39;s 7B model. This 13B model was later expanded and continually trained, becoming the second-generation 38B dense model (which was the main mid-range Pangu model for several months) and was once quite competitive. However, because the larger 135B model had an outdated architecture and was severely damaged by the vocabulary change (later analysis revealed that the stitched-together vocabulary had even more serious bugs), its performance after continued training still lagged far behind leading domestic models like Qwen. The internal criticism and pressure from leadership grew even stronger. The team was practically in a desperate situation.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Under these circumstances, Wang Yunhe and his Small Model Lab stepped in. They claimed to have inherited and modified the parameters from the old 135B model, and by training on just a few hundred billion tokens, they improved various metrics by an average of about ten points. In reality, this was their first masterpiece of &amp;quot;shell-wrapping&amp;quot; (套壳, i.e., putting a new shell on another company&amp;#39;s model) applied to a large model. At Huawei, laymen lead experts, so the leadership had no concept of how absurd this was; they just thought there must be some algorithmic innovation. After internal analysis, it was discovered that they had actually continued training on Qwen 1.5 110B, adding layers, expanding the FFN dimensions, and incorporating some mechanisms from the Pangu-Pi paper to reach about 135B parameters. In fact, the old 135B had 107 layers, while this new model only had 82, and various other configurations were different. After training, the distribution of many parameters in the new, mysterious 135B model was almost identical to Qwen 110B. Even the class name in the model&amp;#39;s code was &amp;quot;Qwen&amp;quot; at the time; they were too lazy to even change it. This model later became the so-called 135B V2. And this model was provided to many downstream teams, including external customers.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This incident was a huge blow to those of us colleagues who were doing our work seriously and honestly. Many people internally, including those in the Terminal and Huawei Cloud divisions, knew about this. We all joked that we should stop calling it the Pangu model and call it the &amp;quot;Qiangu&amp;quot; model instead (a pun combining Qwen and Pangu). At the time, team members wanted to report this to the BCG (Business Conduct Guidelines) office, as it was major business fraud. But later, it was said that a leader stopped them, because higher-level leaders (like Teacher Yao, and possibly Director Xiong and Elder Zha) also found out later but did nothing about it. Getting good results through shell-wrapping was also beneficial to them. This event caused several of the team&amp;#39;s strongest members to become disheartened, and talk of resignation became commonplace.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;At this point, Pangu seemed to find a turning point. Since the Pangu models mentioned earlier were mostly based on continued training and modification, Noah&amp;#39;s Ark at that time had no grasp of training technology from scratch, let alone on Ascend&amp;#39;s NPUs. Thanks to the strenuous efforts of the team&amp;#39;s core members, Pangu began training its third-generation models. After immense effort, the data architecture and training algorithms gradually caught up with the industry. The people from the Small Model Lab had nothing to do with this hardship.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Initially, the team members had no confidence and started with just a 13B model. But later, they found the results were quite good. So this model was later expanded again, becoming the third-generation 38B, codenamed 38B V3. I&amp;#39;m sure many brothers in the product lines are familiar with this model. At that time, this model&amp;#39;s tokenizer was an extension of Llama&amp;#39;s vocabulary (a common practice in the industry). Meanwhile, Wang Yunhe&amp;#39;s lab created another vocabulary (which later became the vocabulary for the Pangu series). The two vocabularies were forced into a &amp;quot;horse race&amp;quot; (a competitive trial), which ended with no clear winner. So, the leadership immediately decided that the vocabularies should be unified, and Wang Yunhe&amp;#39;s should be used. Consequently, the 135B V3 (known externally as Pangu Ultra), which was trained from scratch, adopted this tokenizer. This also explains the confusion many brothers who used our models had: why two models of the same V3 generation, but different sizes, used different tokenizers.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;From the bottom of our hearts, we feel that the 135B V3 was the pride of our Fourth Column team at the time. It was the first truly full-stack, self-developed, properly from-scratch-trained, hundred-billion-parameter-level model from Huawei, and its performance was comparable to competitors in early 2024. Writing this, I am already in tears. It was so incredibly difficult. To ensure stable training, the team conducted a large number of comparative experiments and performed timely rollbacks and restarts whenever the model&amp;#39;s gradients showed anomalies. This model truly achieved what was later stated in the technical report: not a single loss spike throughout the entire training process. We overcame countless difficulties. We did it. We are willing to guarantee the authenticity of this model&amp;#39;s training with our lives and honor. How many sleepless nights did we spend for its training? How wronged and aggrieved did we feel when we were being worthless in internal forums? We persevered.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We are the ones who were truly burning our youth to build up China&amp;#39;s domestic computing foundation... Away from home, we gave up our families, our holidays, our health, and our entertainment. We risked everything. The hardships and difficulties involved cannot be fully described in a few words. At various mobilization meetings, when we shouted slogans like &amp;quot;Pangu will prevail, Huawei will prevail,&amp;quot; we were genuinely and deeply moved.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;However, all the fruits of our hard work were often casually taken by the Small Model Lab. Data? They just demanded it. Code? They just took it and even required us to help adapt it so it could be run with a single click. We used to joke that the Small Model Lab was the &amp;quot;mouse-clicking lab.&amp;quot; We did the hard work; they reaped the glory. It really is true what they say: &amp;quot;You are carrying a heavy burden so that someone else can live a peaceful life.&amp;quot; Under these circumstances, more and more of our comrades could no longer hold on and chose to leave. Seeing those brilliant colleagues leave one by one, I felt both regret and sadness. In this battle-like environment, we were more like comrades-in-arms than colleagues. They were also great teachers from whom I could learn countless technical things. Seeing them go to outstanding teams like ByteDance&amp;#39;s Seed, Deepseek, Moonshot AI, Tencent, and Kuaishou, I am genuinely happy for them and wish them the best for escaping this exhausting and dirty place. I still vividly remember what a colleague who left said: &amp;quot;Coming here was a disgrace to my technical career. Every day I stay here is a waste of life.&amp;quot; The words were harsh, but they left me speechless. I worried about my own lack of technical expertise and my inability to adapt to the high-turnover environment of internet companies, which kept me from taking the step to resign despite thinking about it many times.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Besides dense models, Pangu later began exploring MoE models. Initially, a 224B MoE model was trained. In parallel, the Small Model Lab launched its second major shell-wrapping operation (minor incidents may have included other models, like a math model), which is the now infamous Pangu-Pro MoE 72B. This model was internally claimed to have been expanded from the Small Model Lab&amp;#39;s 7B model (even if true, this contradicts the technical report, let alone the fact that it was continued training on a shell of Qwen 2.5&amp;#39;s 14B). I remember that just a few days after they started training, their internal evaluation scores immediately caught up with our 38B V3 at the time. Many brothers in the AI System Lab knew about their shell-wrapping operation because they needed to adapt the model, but for various reasons, they couldn&amp;#39;t bring justice to light. In fact, for this model that was trained for a very long time afterward, I am surprised that HonestAGI was able to detect this level of similarity. The computing power spent on &amp;quot;washing&amp;quot; the parameters to continue training would have been more than enough to train a model of the same size from scratch. I heard from colleagues that they used many methods to wash away Qwen&amp;#39;s watermark, even intentionally training it on dirty data. This provides an unprecedented case study for the academic community researching model &amp;quot;lineage.&amp;quot; New lineage detection methods in the future can be tested on this.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In late 2024 and early 2025, after the release of Deepseek v3 and r1, our team was hit hard by their stunning technical level and faced even greater skepticism. To keep up with the trend, Pangu imitated Deepseek&amp;#39;s model size and began training a 718B MoE model. At this time, the Small Model Lab struck again. They chose to shell-wrap and continue training on Deepseek-v3. They trained the model by freezing the parameters loaded from Deepseek. Even the directory for loading the checkpoint was named deepseekv3—they didn&amp;#39;t even bother to change it. How arrogant is that? In contrast, some colleagues with true technical integrity were training another 718B MoE from scratch, but they encountered all sorts of problems. But obviously, how could this model ever be better than a direct shell-wrap? If it weren&amp;#39;t for the team leader&amp;#39;s insistence, it would have been shut down long ago.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Huawei&amp;#39;s cumbersome process management severely slows down the R&amp;amp;D pace of large models, with things like version control, model lineage, various procedures, and traceability requirements. Ironically, the Small Model Lab&amp;#39;s models never seem to be bound by these processes. They can shell-wrap whenever they want, continue training whenever they want, and endlessly demand computing resources. This stark, almost surreal contrast illustrates the current state of process management: &amp;quot;The magistrates are allowed to set fires, but the common people are not even allowed to light lamps.&amp;quot; How ridiculous? How tragic? How hateful? How shameful!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After the HonestAGI incident, we were forced into endless internal discussions and analyses on how to handle public relations and &amp;quot;respond.&amp;quot; Admittedly, the original analysis might not have been strong enough, giving Wang Yunhe and the Small Model Lab an opportunity to argue and twist the truth. For this, I have felt sick to my stomach these past two days, constantly questioning the meaning of my life and whether there is any justice in the world. I&amp;#39;m not playing along anymore. I&amp;#39;m going to resign. I am also applying to have my name removed from the author list of some of the Pangu technical reports. Having my name on those reports is a stain on my life that I can never erase. At the time, I never thought they would be brazen enough to open-source it. I never thought they would dare to fool the world like this and promote it so heavily. At that time, perhaps I was holding onto a sliver of wishful thinking and didn&amp;#39;t refuse to be listed as an author. I believe many of my dedicated comrades were also forced onto this pirate ship or were unaware of the situation. But this can&amp;#39;t be undone. I hope to spend the rest of my life doing solid, meaningful work to atone for my weakness and indecisiveness back then.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Writing this late at night, I am already in tears, sobbing uncontrollably. I remember when some outstanding colleagues were leaving, I asked them with a wry smile if they were going to post a long, customary farewell message on the internal forum to expose the situation. They replied, &amp;quot;No, it&amp;#39;s a waste of time, and I&amp;#39;m afraid it would make things even worse for you all.&amp;quot; At that moment, I felt a deep sense of sorrow, because my comrades, with whom I had once fought for a common ideal, had completely lost faith in Huawei. We used to joke that we were using the Communist Party&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;millet plus rifles&amp;quot; (meager resources) while the organization had the style of the Kuomintang (corrupt and bureaucratic).&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There was a time when I was proud that we were using &amp;quot;millet plus rifles&amp;quot; to defeat foreign guns and cannons.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I am tired. I want to surrender.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;To this day, I still sincerely hope that Huawei can learn its lesson, do Pangu right, make Pangu world-class, and bring Ascend to the level of Nvidia. The internal phenomenon of &amp;quot;bad money driving out good&amp;quot; has caused Noah&amp;#39;s Ark, and even Huawei, to rapidly lose a large number of outstanding large model talents. I believe they are now shining in various teams like Deepseek, realizing their ambitions and talents, and contributing to the fierce AI competition between China and the US. I often lament that Huawei doesn&amp;#39;t lack talent; it simply doesn&amp;#39;t know how to retain it. If these people were given the right environment, the right resources, fewer shackles, and less political infighting, what would stop Pangu from succeeding?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Finally: I swear on my life, character, and honor that everything I have written above is true (at least within my limited knowledge). I do not have the high level of technical skill or the opportunity to conduct a thorough and solid analysis, nor do I dare to use internal records as direct evidence for fear of being caught through information security. But I believe many of my former comrades will vouch for me. To my brothers still inside Huawei, including those in the product lines we served, I believe the countless details in this article will resonate with your own impressions and corroborate my claims. You too may have been deceived, but these cruel truths will not remain buried. The traces of our struggle should not be distorted and buried either.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Having written so much, certain people will surely want to find me and silence me. The company might even try to shut me up or hold me accountable. If that happens, my personal safety, and even that of my family, could be threatened. For my own protection, I will report that I am safe to everyone daily in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;If I disappear, just consider it my sacrifice for truth and ideals, for the better development of computing power and AI in Huawei and even in China. I am willing to be buried in that place where I once fought.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Goodbye, Noah&amp;#39;s Ark.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Written in the early morning of July 6, 2024, in Shenzhen.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":false,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"preview":{"images":[{"source":{"url":"https://external-preview.redd.it/zsmjMuXowo6jxdudGrk9wGSfEsVxthNq-2hajJYOL-E.png?auto=webp&amp;s=d1fc95df557e517296d063a22042eef5ed50f992","width":1200,"height":600},"resolutions":[{"url":"https://external-preview.redd.it/zsmjMuXowo6jxdudGrk9wGSfEsVxthNq-2hajJYOL-E.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b71d8efca52378ba322ecd875577a0af62ed340","width":108,"height":54},{"url":"https://external-preview.redd.it/zsmjMuXowo6jxdudGrk9wGSfEsVxthNq-2hajJYOL-E.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1b14c78e45c0bed7f22b08de5eb741847423295","width":216,"height":108},{"url":"https://external-preview.redd.it/zsmjMuXowo6jxdudGrk9wGSfEsVxthNq-2hajJYOL-E.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6950b7069c39533ef70a08d41ffaf416ad4a6cd8","width":320,"height":160},{"url":"https://external-preview.redd.it/zsmjMuXowo6jxdudGrk9wGSfEsVxthNq-2hajJYOL-E.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fddf3b8cc0f1ce4d31ca32da24bad1812e7d04a4","width":640,"height":320},{"url":"https://external-preview.redd.it/zsmjMuXowo6jxdudGrk9wGSfEsVxthNq-2hajJYOL-E.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2551254d47bf69238c423bba4f0df65847e26465","width":960,"height":480},{"url":"https://external-preview.redd.it/zsmjMuXowo6jxdudGrk9wGSfEsVxthNq-2hajJYOL-E.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2fa046d88b67b2edd536e641d7af08f5174d521","width":1080,"height":540}],"variants":{},"id":"zsmjMuXowo6jxdudGrk9wGSfEsVxthNq-2hajJYOL-E"}],"enabled":false},"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"5f921ea4-c7bc-11ed-9c23-3a00622979b4","can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_81eyvm","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"#646d73","id":"1lsz4hk","is_robot_indexable":true,"num_duplicates":0,"report_reasons":null,"author":"Rich-Mushroom-8360","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":48,"send_replies":true,"media":null,"contest_mode":false,"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1lsz4hk/huaweis_pangu_ai_rocked_by_unverified_claims_of/","stickied":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1lsz4hk/huaweis_pangu_ai_rocked_by_unverified_claims_of/","subreddit_subscribers":496034,"created_utc":1751801803,"num_crossposts":0,"mod_reports":[],"is_video":false}}],"before":null}},{"kind":"Listing","data":{"after":null,"dist":null,"modhash":"","geo_filter":"","children":[{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_81eyvm","approved_at_utc":null,"author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"awarders":[],"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"LocalLLaMA","author_flair_template_id":null,"likes":null,"replies":{"kind":"Listing","data":{"after":null,"dist":null,"modhash":"","geo_filter":"","children":[{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_81eyvm","approved_at_utc":null,"author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"awarders":[],"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"LocalLLaMA","author_flair_template_id":null,"likes":null,"replies":"","user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"n1netqm","banned_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":false,"author":"MentalMatricies","can_mod_post":false,"created_utc":1751816347,"send_replies":true,"parent_id":"t1_n1n1kmm","score":8,"author_fullname":"t2_1cot7yhiz0","removal_reason":null,"approved_by":null,"mod_note":null,"all_awardings":[],"body":"I’m with you here mate.
