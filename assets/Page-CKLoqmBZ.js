And then suddenly everyone realized “oh shit, the old distribution model isn’t working anymore” and very quickly everything changed.\\n\\nOff topic sidebar:\\n\\nWhile your timeline isn't wrong your conclusions aren't correct about Netscape. Netscape's valuation wasn't about a single piece of software or how it was sold but instead the fact they invented the SaaS distribution model before that term was coined. Netscape saw the Internet (in 1994) the way we all see the Internet today. For many people the computer and OS they access the we the Internet on is incidental, the real value is the sites and services we're using.\\n\\nNetscape was really into \\"network computing\\" where the device you used for the Internet was just a terminal connecting you to a bunch of online services. It would be like an X terminal that displayed web pages, basically a Chromebook. Navigator was the first step on that path. If a *website* could provide the same capability as a packaged piece of software and it could be accessed from a PC, Mac, or Unix workstation then the host OS and developer tools became a commodity. Netscape also produced a lot of back end software like application servers and a web server. They wanted the Netscape back end APIs to be where ISVs targeted development. \\n\\n*This* was the aspect of Netscape that spooked Microsoft into action. At the time Microsoft made their money selling Windows, Office, and their developer tools. This was predicated on Windows being the 800lb gorilla running on every computer in front of people. They bundled IE with Windows to cut off Netscape's oxygen supply. Netscape's operating income was in part from boxed software sales and licensed bundled copies with OEMs. Microsoft also changed their OEM agreements that prevented them from bundling Navigator with new PCs (which got them in anti-trust trouble).\\n\\nAlongside IE bundling with Windows Microsoft also released a bunch of back end software, tied to Windows of course, to compete with Netscape's offerings. IIS and ISAPI were direct competition to Netscape's application and web server offerings. Before Netscape Microsoft largely saw (seemingly so) the server side of computing as file and print serving. Their BackOffice products were mostly about managing Windows PCs as clients rather than serving up services written by ISVs. \\n\\nNote a big difference between Netscape's vision of SaaS and how the modern web has played out was the rise of JavaScript on the client side. In Netscape's vision the output from services would be static HTML and form controls with some styling.

And then suddenly everyone realized “oh shit, the old distribution model isn’t working anymore” and very quickly everything changed.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Off topic sidebar:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;While your timeline isn&amp;#39;t wrong your conclusions aren&amp;#39;t correct about Netscape. Netscape&amp;#39;s valuation wasn&amp;#39;t about a single piece of software or how it was sold but instead the fact they invented the SaaS distribution model before that term was coined. Netscape saw the Internet (in 1994) the way we all see the Internet today. For many people the computer and OS they access the we the Internet on is incidental, the real value is the sites and services we&amp;#39;re using.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Netscape was really into &amp;quot;network computing&amp;quot; where the device you used for the Internet was just a terminal connecting you to a bunch of online services. It would be like an X terminal that displayed web pages, basically a Chromebook. Navigator was the first step on that path. If a &lt;em&gt;website&lt;/em&gt; could provide the same capability as a packaged piece of software and it could be accessed from a PC, Mac, or Unix workstation then the host OS and developer tools became a commodity. Netscape also produced a lot of back end software like application servers and a web server. They wanted the Netscape back end APIs to be where ISVs targeted development. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; was the aspect of Netscape that spooked Microsoft into action. At the time Microsoft made their money selling Windows, Office, and their developer tools. This was predicated on Windows being the 800lb gorilla running on every computer in front of people. They bundled IE with Windows to cut off Netscape&amp;#39;s oxygen supply. Netscape&amp;#39;s operating income was in part from boxed software sales and licensed bundled copies with OEMs. Microsoft also changed their OEM agreements that prevented them from bundling Navigator with new PCs (which got them in anti-trust trouble).&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Alongside IE bundling with Windows Microsoft also released a bunch of back end software, tied to Windows of course, to compete with Netscape&amp;#39;s offerings. IIS and ISAPI were direct competition to Netscape&amp;#39;s application and web server offerings. Before Netscape Microsoft largely saw (seemingly so) the server side of computing as file and print serving. Their BackOffice products were mostly about managing Windows PCs as clients rather than serving up services written by ISVs. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Note a big difference between Netscape&amp;#39;s vision of SaaS and how the modern web has played out was the rise of JavaScript on the client side. In Netscape&amp;#39;s vision the output from services would be static HTML and form controls with some styling. The processing requirements on the client side would be minimal compared to the server side resources. For things HTML couldn&amp;#39;t handle they&amp;#39;d pass off work to Java applets. Java being platform agnostic fit in with their platform agnostic vision of &amp;quot;software&amp;quot; delivery.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In today&amp;#39;s realization of SaaS JavaScript has taken the place of Java applets. Unfortunately it&amp;#39;s also pushed up the client side compute requirements since a web app is as resource intensive as a native application running locally.

This could be a bad sign of things to come.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic for example has a reasoning model way more advanced than o3 but it&amp;#39;s not been released or teased because they have a way more comprehensive safety and alignment lab that actually cares about these things.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;","removal_reason":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"distinguished":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":false,"gildings":{},"unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1iaebwp/financial_times_deepseek_shocked_silicon_valley/m99poxn/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"report_reasons":null,"created":1737901749,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"link_id":"t3_1iaebwp","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/LocalLLaMA","controversiality":0,"depth":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"mod_reports":[],"num_reports":null,"ups":23}},{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_81eyvm","approved_at_utc":null,"author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"awarders":[],"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"LocalLLaMA","author_flair_template_id":null,"likes":null,"replies":{"kind":"Listing","data":{"after":null,"dist":null,"modhash":"","geo_filter":"","children":[{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_81eyvm","approved_at_utc":null,"author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"awarders":[],"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"LocalLLaMA","author_flair_template_id":null,"likes":null,"replies":"","user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"m9f7tvm","banned_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"ThrowItAllAway1269","can_mod_post":false,"created_utc":1737966817,"send_replies":true,"parent_id":"t1_m9anc1s","score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_avxx90yz","removal_reason":null,"approved_by":null,"mod_note":null,"all_awardings":[],"body":"Everything is a political move.
