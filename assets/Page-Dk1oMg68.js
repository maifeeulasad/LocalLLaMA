Here are some updates:\\n\\n1. We've added a [changelog](https://www.designarena.ai/changelog) of when each model was added or deactivated from the arena. System prompts can be found in [methodology](https://www.designarena.ai/about) or [this page](https://www.designarena.ai/system-prompts). The system prompts were meant to be very simple, but feel free to provide your critiques on them (we acknowledge they're not the best).   \\n  \\n2. Devstral Medium, Devstral Small 1.1, Qwen3 30B-A3B, Mistral Small 3.2, and kimi-k2 were added to the area. Note that the temperature of kimi-k2 is set to be low right now since we're using the public api (0.3 instead of 0.8 for the other models) but we will modify that when we switch to better hosting.   \\n  \\n3. Working on adding more models suggested [in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1lwxr2l/what_other_models_would_you_like_to_see_on_design/) such as GLM-4, Gemma, more moonshot models, and more open source / smaller models. It's actually been quite interesting to see that many of the [OS models / smaller ones are holding their weight](https://www.designarena.ai/leaderboard) against the giants. \\n\\n4. Grok 4 might be crushing every benchmark left and right, but for coding (specifically frontend dev and UI/UX), people haven't found the model to be all that impressive. xAI didn't appear to intend for Grok 4 to be a 100X developer, but we'll see how it's coding model will fare in August (or maybe September). \\n\\nThose are the major updates. One food for thought is how will Open AI's open source model do on here, given that none of its flagships are even in the top 10.   \\n  \\nAs always let us know what we can do better and what else you'd like to see!
