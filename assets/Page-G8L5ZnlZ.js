In particular, I made [a post yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1lthtbn/85k_people_voted_on_which_ai_models_create_the/) that gave us a ton of useful feedback so thank you to everyone that put in a comment and voted on our platform! I just wanted to address some concerns, provide some updates on what we are working on, and create an open discussion on how the benchmark can be improved. This post will be a bit long since I want to be as detailed as possible, but here we go:\\n\\n**Context:** We released the benchmark just a few weeks ago (3 weeks ago I think?) and mostly it started out as an internal tool among my team since we were interested in the current UI/UX capabilities of LLMs and HCI and wanted to see which models are best at designing and implementing interfaces. We really just pushed the benchmark out initially as a fun side project to see what would happen, but really didn't forsee that we would get over 10K people on our site at some point! Our motivation here is that something like UI/UX data for AI seems that it will be heavily reliant on public opinion, rather than a deterministic benchmark or private evaluation. \\n\\nAs I said, we received a lot of very helpful feedback, and as we're still in very early early stages with developing the benchmark, we're really trying to do our best to make our benchmark as transparent and useful as possible. \\n\\n**More Models and Voting Inconsistency:** Many people have noted that many premier models are missing such as GLM-4, Qwen, Gemini 2.5-Flash, etc. We are working on adding those and hope to add those models in the next couple of days and will update you all when those are added. I realize I have been saying that more models will be added for more than a few days now haha, but honestly we are a small team with not an infinite amount of money lol, so we're just waiting to get some more credits. I hope that makes sense and thank you for your patience! \\n\\nAnother comment we got is that the number of votes received for the different models are vastly different even though voting should be recruiting models at random. There are few reasons for this: (1) we added some models earlier (notably Claude when we were first developing the benchmark) and other models later (Mistral, Llama, etc.), (2) we did deactivate some models that became deprecated or because we ran out of credits (such as Llama which we're deploying on Vertex but we will add back) and (3) for slower models like DeepSeek, we do notice churn from voters in the sense that people won't wait for those models to finish generating all the time. \\n\\nFor (1) and (2) we will address by providing exact details on when we added each model and adding back models (assuming they are not deprecated) such as Llama. For (3), we have put some thought into this over the last few weeks but honestly not sure how exactly we should tackle this issue since this is a bit of a limitation of having a public crowdsource benchmark. We did get some suggestions to perhaps have some priority for models with fewer votes, but there is a correlation between having fewer votes and slower generation times, so we don't think there is an immediate fix there but we likely incorporate some kind of priority system. That said, we would appreciate any suggestions on (3)! \\n\\n**Voting Data:** To be clear, this is standard preference dataset that we collect when users do binary comparisons on our [voting page](https://www.designarena.ai/vote). We'll be releasing a preference dataset that can be accessed through Hugging Face and/or a REST API that will be updated periodically and that people can use to replicate the leaderboard. Note that the [leaderboard page is currently being updated every hour](https://www.designarena.ai/leaderboard).   \\n  \\n**System Prompts and Model Configs:** We will also release these along with the preference dataset and make our current settings much more clear. You'll get full access to these configs, but for the we're asking each model (with the same sys prompt across the board) to create an interface using HTML/CSS/JS with some restrictions (to ensure sure the code is sandboxed as possible + allowing it to use specific libraries like ThreeJs for 3D viz, Tailwind, etc.). For model configs, we are setting temperature to 0.8. \\n\\n**Tournaments:** This was more of an aesthetic choice on our part to make the voting process more interesting for the user and get more comparisons for the same prompt across models. We'll also provide exact details on how these are being constructed, but the idea is that we're recruiting X number of models that are each being voted on in a group. We have had too kind of tournament structures. In the first, we would serve two models, have a user vote, and then continually have the winner go against the next served model. We decided to change this structure because we weren't able to compare losers in the bracket. For the current tournament system, we have two models A and B go against each other and then two other models C and D go against each other in round 1. Then the winners from the first round and losers from the last round go against each other. After that the loser in the winners' bracket will go against the winner in the losers' bracket to decide 2nd and 3rd place. We don't think this structure is necessarily perfect, but just more of an aesthetic choice so people could see different models at the same time in a grouping. We acknowledge that with the preference data, you could certainly structure the tournament data differently and our tournament structure shouldn't be considered as the absolute \\"correct\\" one.  \\n\\n**Stack Ranking/Leaderboard:** This is where we acknowledge that there's certainly room for improvement here on how we can construct the leaderboard based on the preference data. Some of the concerns raised we did think about briefly in the past, but will certainly take more time to consider what's the best kind of ranking. Right now though, we have a ranking by win rate, and then an \\"Elo\\" score (which we're using an approximate formula based on win rate for which you can find at the bottom of the [leaderboard](https://www.designarena.ai/leaderboard)). A concern raised that is relevant to what was said above is that the number of votes a model has does have an effect on the placement in the leaderboard. We will probably add some way to weight win rate / elo score by number votes, and any suggestions on what would be the best stack ranking here would be appreciated! That said, I do think it might be good to not take the leaderboard as this definitive ranking, since one could construct their own different kind of leaderboards / rankings based on how they choose to structure the preference data, but more so treat it as a general \\"tier list\\" for the models. \\n\\nLet us know what you think and if you have any questions in the comments! \\n\\nPlease also join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/5AagpZd5) for the best way to message us directly.
