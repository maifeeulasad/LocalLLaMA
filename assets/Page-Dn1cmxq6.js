As a long-time Mac user, I honestly never had a real need for it. That all changed when I stumbled into the world of local AI. Suddenly, my 16GB Mac wasn't just slow, it was a hard bottleneck.\\n\\nSo, I started mapping out what this new machine needed to be:\\n\\n\\\\- **32GB VRAM as the baseline.** I'm really bullish on the future of MoE models and think 32-64gigs of VRAM should hold quite well.  \\n\\\\- **128GB of RAM as the baseline.** Essential for wrangling the large datasets that come with the territory.  \\n\\\\- **A clean, consumer-desk look.** I don't want a rugged, noisy server rack.  \\n\\\\- **AI inference as the main job,** but I didn't want a one-trick pony. It still needed to be a decent all-rounder for daily tasks and, of course, some gaming.  \\n\\\\- **Room to grow.** I wanted a foundation I could build on later.  \\n\\\\- And the big one: **Keep it under $1500.**\\n\\nA new Mac with these specs would cost a fortune and be a dead end for upgrades. New NVIDIA cards? Forget about it, way too expensive. I looked at used 3090s, but they were still going for about $1000 where I am, and that was a definite no-no for my budget.\\n\\nJust as I was about to give up, I discovered the AMD MI50. The price-to-performance was incredible, and I started getting excited. Sure, the raw power isn't record-breaking, but the idea of running massive models and getting such insane value for my money was a huge draw.\\n\\nBut here was the catch: these are server cards. Even though they have a display port, it doesn't actually work. That would have killed my \\"all-rounder\\" requirement.\\n\\nI started digging deep, trying to find a workaround. That's when I hit a wall. Everywhere I looked, the consensus was the same: cross-flashing the VBIOS on these cards to enable the display port was a dead end for the 32GB version. It was largely declared impossible...\\n\\n...until the kind-hearted u/Accurate_Ad4323 from China stepped in to confirm it was possible. They even told me I could get the 32GB MI50s for as cheap as $130 from China, and that some people there had even programmed custom VBIOSes specifically for these 32GB cards. With all these pieces of crucial info, I was sold.\\n\\nI still had my doubts. Was this custom VBIOS stable? Would it mess with AI performance? There was practically no info out there about this on the 32GB cards, only the 16GB ones. Could I really trust a random stranger's advice? And with ROCm's reputation for being a bit tricky, I didn't want to make my life even harder.\\n\\nIn the end, I decided to pull the trigger. Worst-case scenario? I'd have 64GB of HBM2 memory for AI work for about $300, just with no display output. I decided to treat a working display as a bonus.\\n\\nI found a reliable seller on Alibaba who specialized in server gear and was selling the MI50 for $137. I browsed their store and found some other lucrative deals, formulating my build list right there.\\n\\nHere’s what I ordered from them:\\n\\n\\\\- Supermicro X11DPI-N -&gt; $320  \\n\\\\- Dual Xeon 6148 CPUs -&gt; 27 \\\\* 2 = $54  \\n\\\\- 2x CPU Coolers -&gt; $62  \\n\\\\- 2x MI50 32GB GPUs -&gt; $137 \\\\* 2 = $274  \\n\\\\- 4x 32GB DDR4 2666hz ECC RDIMM RAM sticks -&gt; $124  \\n\\\\- 10x 120mm RGB fans -&gt; $32  \\n\\\\- 6x 140mm RGB fans -&gt; $27  \\n\\\\- 2x custom cooling shrouded fans for MI50s -&gt; $14  \\n\\\\- Shipping + Duties -&gt; $187\\n\\nI know people get skeptical about Alibaba, but in my opinion, you're safe as long as you find the right seller, use a reliable freight forwarder, and always buy through Trade Assurance.\\n\\nWhen the parts arrived, one of the Xeon CPUs was DOA. It took some back-and-forth, but the seller was great and sent a replacement for free once they were convinced (I offered to cover the shipping on it, which is included in that $187 cost).\\n\\nI also bought these peripherals brand-new:\\n\\n\\\\- Phanteks Enthoo Pro 2 Server Edition -&gt; $200  \\n\\\\- ProLab 1200W 80Plus Gold PSU -&gt; $100  \\n\\\\- 2TB NVMe SSD (For Ubuntu) -&gt; $100  \\n\\\\- 1TB 2.5 SSD (For Windows) -&gt; $50\\n\\nAll in, I spent exactly **$1544.**\\n\\nNow for the two final hurdles:\\n\\n1. **Assembling everything without breaking it!** As a first-timer, it took me about three very careful days, but I'm so proud of how it turned out.\\n2. **Testing that custom VBIOS. Did I get the \\"bonus\\"?** After downloading the VBIOS, finding the right version of amdvbflash to force-flash, and installing the community NimeZ drivers... it actually works!!!\\n\\nNow, to answer the questions I had for myself about the VBIOS cross-flash:\\n\\n**Is it stable?** Totally. It acts just like a regular graphics card from boot-up. The only weird quirk is on Windows: if I set \\"VGA Priority\\" to the GPU in the BIOS, the NimeZ drivers get corrupted. A quick reinstall and switching the priority back to \\"Onboard\\" fixes it. This doesn't happen at all in Ubuntu with ROCm.\\n\\n**Does the flash hurt AI performance?** Surprisingly, no! It performs identically. The VBIOS is based on a Radeon Pro VII, and I've seen zero difference. If anything weird pops up, I'll be sure to update.\\n\\n**Can it game?** Yes! Performance is like a Radeon VII but with a ridiculous 32GB of VRAM. It comfortably handles anything I throw at it in 1080p at max settings and 60fps.\\n\\nI ended up with 64GB of versatile VRAM for under $300, and thanks to the Supermicro board, I have a clear upgrade path to 4TB of RAM and Xeon Platinum CPUs down the line. (if needed)\\n\\nNow, I'll end this off with a couple pictures of the build and some benchmarks.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fev4jvhbn3bf1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23c596ba1d922e7bf231b8dacb4add0c9b8d5790\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n6idruhbn3bf1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9a883ded03b7bb26cf5e291562beff40f68ca71\\n\\n(The build is still a work-in-progress with regards to cable management :facepalm)\\n\\n**Benchmarks:**\\n\\n**llama.cpp:**\\n\\n**A power limit of 150W was imposed on both GPUs for all these tests.**\\n\\n**Qwen3-30B-A3B-128K-UD-Q4\\\\_K\\\\_XL:**\\n\\nbuild/bin/llama-bench --model models/Downloads/Qwen3-30B-A3B-128K-UD-Q4\\\\_K\\\\_XL.gguf -ngl 99 --threads 40 --flash-attn --no-mmap\\n\\n\`| model | size | params | backend | ngl | test | t/s |\`\\n\\n\`| ------------------------------ | --------: | ------: | ------- | --: | ----: | ------------: |\`\\n\\n\`| qwen3moe 30B.A3B Q4_K - Medium | 16.49 GiB | 30.53 B | ROCm | 99 | pp512 | 472.40 ± 2.44 |\`\\n\\n\`| qwen3moe 30B.A3B Q4_K - Medium | 16.49 GiB | 30.53 B | ROCm | 99 | tg128 | 49.40 ± 0.07 |\`\\n\\n**Magistral-Small-2506-UD-Q4\\\\_K\\\\_XL:**\\n\\nbuild/bin/llama-bench --model models/Downloads/Magistral-Small-2506-UD-Q4\\\\_K\\\\_XL.gguf -ngl 99 --threads 40 --flash-attn --no-mmap\\n\\n\`| model | size | params | backend | ngl | test | t/s |\`\\n\\n\`| ------------------------------ | ---------: | ---------: | ---------- | --: | --------------: | -------------------: |\`\\n\\n\`| llama 13B Q4_K - Medium | 13.50 GiB | 23.57 B | ROCm | 99 | pp512 | 130.75 ± 0.09 |\`\\n\\n\`| llama 13B Q4_K - Medium | 13.50 GiB | 23.57 B | ROCm | 99 | tg128 | 20.96 ± 0.09 |\`\\n\\n**gemma-3-27b-it-Q4\\\\_K\\\\_M:**\\n\\nbuild/bin/llama-bench --model models/Downloads/gemma-3-27b-it-Q4\\\\_K\\\\_M.gguf -ngl 99 --threads 40 --flash-attn --no-mmap\\n\\n\`| model | size | params | backend | ngl | test | t/s |\`\\n\\n\`| ------------------------------ | ---------: | ---------: | ---------- | --: | --------------: | -------------------: |\`\\n\\n\`| gemma3 27B Q4_K - Medium | 15.40 GiB | 27.01 B | ROCm | 99 | pp512 | 110.88 ± 3.01 |\`\\n\\n\`| gemma3 27B Q4_K - Medium | 15.40 GiB | 27.01 B | ROCm | 99 | tg128 | 17.98 ± 0.02 |\`\\n\\n**Qwen3-32B-Q4\\\\_K\\\\_M:**\\n\\nbuild/bin/llama-bench --model models/Downloads/Qwen3-32B-Q4\\\\_K\\\\_M.gguf -ngl 99 --threads 40 --flash-attn --no-mmap\\n\\n\`| model | size | params | backend | ngl | test | t/s |\`\\n\\n\`| ----------------------- | --------: | ------: | ------- | --: | ----: | -----------: |\`\\n\\n\`| qwen3 32B Q4_K - Medium | 18.40 GiB | 32.76 B | ROCm | 99 | pp512 | 91.72 ± 0.03 |\`\\n\\n\`| qwen3 32B Q4_K - Medium | 18.40 GiB | 32.76 B | ROCm | 99 | tg128 | 16.12 ± 0.01 |\`\\n\\n**Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-UD-Q4\\\\_K\\\\_XL:**\\n\\nbuild/bin/llama-bench --model models/Downloads/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-UD-Q4\\\\_K\\\\_XL.gguf -ngl 99 --threads 40 --flash-attn --no-mmap\\n\\n\`| model | size | params | backend | ngl | test | t/s |\`\\n\\n\`| ------------------------------ | ---------: | ---------: | ---------- | --: | --------------: | -------------------: |\`\\n\\n\`| llama 70B Q4_K - Medium | 39.73 GiB | 70.55 B | ROCm | 99 | pp512 | 42.49 ± 0.05 |\`\\n\\n\`| llama 70B Q4_K - Medium | 39.73 GiB | 70.55 B | ROCm | 99 | tg128 | 7.70 ± 0.01 |\`\\n\\n**Qwen3-235B-A22B-128K-UD-Q2\\\\_K\\\\_XL:**\\n\\nbuild/bin/llama-bench --model models/Downloads/Qwen3-235B-A22B-128K-GGUF/Qwen3-235B-A22B-128K-UD-Q2\\\\_K\\\\_XL-00001-of-00002.gguf -ot '(4-7+).ffn\\\\_.\\\\_exps.=CPU' -ngl 99 --threads 40 --flash-attn --no-mmap\\n\\n\`| model | size | params | backend | ngl | ot | test | t/s |\`\\n\\n\`| ------------------------------ | ---------: | ---------: | ---------- | --: | --------------------- | --------------: | -------------------: |\`\\n\\n\`| qwen3moe 235B.A22B Q2_K - Medium | 81.96 GiB | 235.09 B | ROCm | 99 | (4-7+).ffn_._exps.=CPU | pp512 | 29.80 ± 0.15 |\`\\n\\n\`| qwen3moe 235B.A22B Q2_K - Medium | 81.96 GiB | 235.09 B | ROCm | 99 | (4-7+).ffn_._exps.=CPU | tg128 | 7.45 ± 0.09 |\`\\n\\nI'm aware of the severe multi-GPU performance bottleneck with llama.cpp. Just started messing with vLLM, exLlamav2 and MLC-LLM.

Even though they have a display port, it doesn&amp;#39;t actually work. That would have killed my &amp;quot;all-rounder&amp;quot; requirement.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I started digging deep, trying to find a workaround. That&amp;#39;s when I hit a wall. Everywhere I looked, the consensus was the same: cross-flashing the VBIOS on these cards to enable the display port was a dead end for the 32GB version. It was largely declared impossible...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;...until the kind-hearted &lt;a href=\\"/u/Accurate_Ad4323\\"&gt;u/Accurate_Ad4323&lt;/a&gt; from China stepped in to confirm it was possible. They even told me I could get the 32GB MI50s for as cheap as $130 from China, and that some people there had even programmed custom VBIOSes specifically for these 32GB cards. With all these pieces of crucial info, I was sold.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I still had my doubts. Was this custom VBIOS stable? Would it mess with AI performance? There was practically no info out there about this on the 32GB cards, only the 16GB ones. Could I really trust a random stranger&amp;#39;s advice? And with ROCm&amp;#39;s reputation for being a bit tricky, I didn&amp;#39;t want to make my life even harder.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In the end, I decided to pull the trigger. Worst-case scenario? I&amp;#39;d have 64GB of HBM2 memory for AI work for about $300, just with no display output. I decided to treat a working display as a bonus.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I found a reliable seller on Alibaba who specialized in server gear and was selling the MI50 for $137. I browsed their store and found some other lucrative deals, formulating my build list right there.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I ordered from them:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;- Supermicro X11DPI-N -&amp;gt; $320&lt;br/&gt;\\n- Dual Xeon 6148 CPUs -&amp;gt; 27 * 2 = $54&lt;br/&gt;\\n- 2x CPU Coolers -&amp;gt; $62&lt;br/&gt;\\n- 2x MI50 32GB GPUs -&amp;gt; $137 * 2 = $274&lt;br/&gt;\\n- 4x 32GB DDR4 2666hz ECC RDIMM RAM sticks -&amp;gt; $124&lt;br/&gt;\\n- 10x 120mm RGB fans -&amp;gt; $32&lt;br/&gt;\\n- 6x 140mm RGB fans -&amp;gt; $27&lt;br/&gt;\\n- 2x custom cooling shrouded fans for MI50s -&amp;gt; $14&lt;br/&gt;\\n- Shipping + Duties -&amp;gt; $187&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I know people get skeptical about Alibaba, but in my opinion, you&amp;#39;re safe as long as you find the right seller, use a reliable freight forwarder, and always buy through Trade Assurance.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When the parts arrived, one of the Xeon CPUs was DOA. It took some back-and-forth, but the seller was great and sent a replacement for free once they were convinced (I offered to cover the shipping on it, which is included in that $187 cost).&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I also bought these peripherals brand-new:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;- Phanteks Enthoo Pro 2 Server Edition -&amp;gt; $200&lt;br/&gt;\\n- ProLab 1200W 80Plus Gold PSU -&amp;gt; $100&lt;br/&gt;\\n- 2TB NVMe SSD (For Ubuntu) -&amp;gt; $100&lt;br/&gt;\\n- 1TB 2.5 SSD (For Windows) -&amp;gt; $50&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;All in, I spent exactly &lt;strong&gt;$1544.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Now for the two final hurdles:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;ol&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assembling everything without breaking it!&lt;/strong&gt; As a first-timer, it took me about three very careful days, but I&amp;#39;m so proud of how it turned out.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing that custom VBIOS. Did I get the &amp;quot;bonus&amp;quot;?&lt;/strong&gt; After downloading the VBIOS, finding the right version of amdvbflash to force-flash, and installing the community NimeZ drivers... it actually works!!!&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ol&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Now, to answer the questions I had for myself about the VBIOS cross-flash:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it stable?&lt;/strong&gt; Totally. It acts just like a regular graphics card from boot-up. The only weird quirk is on Windows: if I set &amp;quot;VGA Priority&amp;quot; to the GPU in the BIOS, the NimeZ drivers get corrupted. A quick reinstall and switching the priority back to &amp;quot;Onboard&amp;quot; fixes it. This doesn&amp;#39;t happen at all in Ubuntu with ROCm.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does the flash hurt AI performance?&lt;/strong&gt; Surprisingly, no! It performs identically. The VBIOS is based on a Radeon Pro VII, and I&amp;#39;ve seen zero difference. If anything weird pops up, I&amp;#39;ll be sure to update.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can it game?&lt;/strong&gt; Yes! Performance is like a Radeon VII but with a ridiculous 32GB of VRAM. It comfortably handles anything I throw at it in 1080p at max settings and 60fps.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I ended up with 64GB of versatile VRAM for under $300, and thanks to the Supermicro board, I have a clear upgrade path to 4TB of RAM and Xeon Platinum CPUs down the line. (if needed)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I&amp;#39;ll end this off with a couple pictures of the build and some benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\\"https://preview.redd.it/fev4jvhbn3bf1.jpg?width=3024&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=23c596ba1d922e7bf231b8dacb4add0c9b8d5790\\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/fev4jvhbn3bf1.jpg?width=3024&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=23c596ba1d922e7bf231b8dacb4add0c9b8d5790&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\\"https://preview.redd.it/n6idruhbn3bf1.jpg?width=3024&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=b9a883ded03b7bb26cf5e291562beff40f68ca71\\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/n6idruhbn3bf1.jpg?width=3024&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=b9a883ded03b7bb26cf5e291562beff40f68ca71&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(The build is still a work-in-progress with regards to cable management :facepalm)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benchmarks:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;llama.cpp:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A power limit of 150W was imposed on both GPUs for all these tests.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qwen3-30B-A3B-128K-UD-Q4_K_XL:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;build/bin/llama-bench --model models/Downloads/Qwen3-30B-A3B-128K-UD-Q4_K_XL.gguf -ngl 99 --threads 40 --flash-attn --no-mmap&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;| model | size | params | backend | ngl | test | t/s |&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;| ------------------------------ | --------: | ------: | ------- | --: | ----: | ------------: |&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;| qwen3moe 30B.A3B Q4_K -

Have one system built around one and have built two more for friends. A few notes:\\n* you can get engineering samples Cascadelake CPUs for very cheap on ebay. Just search for QQ89. Cascadelake brings two benefits: faster memory speed (2933 vs 2666 on Skylake) and significantly higher AVX-512 performance. Cascadelake engineering samples have the same CPUID as production Cascadelake, so they work with the latest BIOS for the motherboard without needing any modifications.\\n* Asetek made a 120mm AIO for for LGA3647. The radiator is small, but very thick. Provides ample cooling for the 165W TDP of most LGA3647 CPUs. Just search ebay for Asetek 570LC 3647. Been using two for a couple of years and really happy with them. Much quieter than most tower coolers. Only the Noctua coolers are quieter but the U12S-3647 and U14S-3647 are still very expensive.\\n* Skylake and Cascadelake really like to have all their channels populated. Each CPU has six memory channels. You really should have all 12 populated for best performance. These are the black DIMMs. The four blue ones are for Optane PDIMMs. You can get those very cheaply on ebay (not as cheap as NVMe though). Just make sure you get those with model numbers that start with NMA. You'll also need to read the motherboard manual thoroughly to learn how to set them up.  If buying optane, get four, two for each CPU.\\n* if you haven't already, get familiar with the board's IPMI interface. It provides so much functionality! IPMItool is also your friend for changing some settings like minimum fan speed or minimum \\"normal\\" fan RPM for each header. The latter will save you a lot of headaches if you're having issues with fan speeds ramping up and down.\\n* X11DPi doesn't support rebar out of the box. Don't know if that has an impact on performance for the MI50. However, ReBarUERFI works with the X11DPi BIOS. Just download the latest from supermicro, patch, and flash it via IPMI. There's zero risk of bricking the board because IPMI can always reflash.\\n* for faster and cheaper NVMe storage, look for either U.2 SSDs or HHHL PCIe X8 SSDs. The X11DPi has two oculink ports for connecting the former, and you can RAID-0 two of them for extra speed. The latter can plug into any of the X8 slots. I have bought 1.6TB U.2 Gen 4 SSDs from ebay for $70 a pop, and 3.2TB Samsung PM1725 HHHL for $90 a pop. Either option has orders of magnitude (20-100) higher endurance than any consumer SSD. So, don't be turned off by listing showing 75% or even 50% life remaining.\\n* If you have the X11DPi-NT, the 10Gb NICs don't work out of the box on Linux, but it's very easy to get them running with a simple Google search. I was surprised by this because on Windows Server they work out of the box.\\n* If you need/want to run Windows, you'll be better off installing Windows Server than Windows 10 or 11. The Server scheduler does a much better job with NUMA.\\n* if running MoE models with layers offloaded to the CPU, you'll get much better performance (as of now) using one CPU only, having a number of threads equal to the number of physical cores of one CPU and pinning those threads on one CPU. On Windows powershell you van use the start command with /affinity 5555 or AAAA (repeat 5 or A by the number of cores of one CPU divided by two, Google for details).
