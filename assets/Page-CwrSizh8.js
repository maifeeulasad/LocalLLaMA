Rule of thumb is that Q4 (more parameters) model &gt; Q8 (fewer parameters) model. For example, if you spec for a 7B model at Q8 quantization, in that same amount of RAM/VRAM you could fit a 14B Q4 model and it should be smarter in most cases. Not faster, but smarter. This is an important distinction, because if you want to just run a 7B Q4 model, you can do that on a toaster, but if you insist on 7B Q8, you might as well go to 14B Q4 directly. You need to decide. \\n\\n2. If you decide on 14B Q4, that should fit in any GPU with 12GB of VRAM or any device with at least 16GB of unified memory if you can use 12GB just for the AI. \\n\\n3. If you can find a device with a dedicated GPU with 12GB of VRAM and it fits in your budget, then this should be your first option. You mentioned you wanted 20 t/s. That's not very realistic on a device with unified memory, but it is achievable on a dedicated GPU. If you keep your expectations in check and want to go for unified memory, see no. 4\\n\\n4. If you get a device with unified memory, get the one with the highest memory bandwidth. This is information that you can find online. Next is the TOPS, which you also can find online, but memory bandwidth is your number one enemy and the first bottleneck. Even if there are no AI benchmarks, you can infer performance based on memory bandwidth. From the ones that you listed there, the M2 Pro has the highest bandwidth I think, but you should double check that. \\n\\n5. If you go for a device with unified memory, don't be tempted to get one with huge amounts of RAM like 64B or 128GB (I know they won't fit your budget, but I'm saying it anyway). Right now anything above 14B running on unified RAM, combined with few TOPS, will have huge drops in prompt processing speed. What that means is even if you manage to load a 32B or 70B model and even if it answers your first question reasonably fast, after a few more questions you will have to wait minutes for it to start answering. This might not be a pleasant experience if you are used to cloud AIs that answer instantly. \\n\\n  \\nTL/DR: If you want to run a smart and fast model, give Qwen 3 4B a try. It will run on anything and I was pleasantly surprised by it. If you want 7B Q8, you might as well jump in the 14B Q4 camp, but that also requires much more expensive hardware. This is the real decision you should make. Don't go beyond 14B cause you'll waste your money and you'll probably not be happy. \\n\\nSee my post here about my experience running LLMs on a phone. It might help put some things into perspective.  \\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1lpzvtx/my\\\\_experience\\\\_with\\\\_14b\\\\_llms\\\\_on\\\\_phones\\\\_with/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1lpzvtx/my_experience_with_14b_llms_on_phones_with/)","edited":false,"top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t1_n1vk54j","is_submitter":false,"downs":0,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"body_html":"&lt;div class=\\"md\\"&gt;&lt;ol&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rule of thumb is that Q4 (more parameters) model &amp;gt; Q8 (fewer parameters) model. For example, if you spec for a 7B model at Q8 quantization, in that same amount of RAM/VRAM you could fit a 14B Q4 model and it should be smarter in most cases. Not faster, but smarter. This is an important distinction, because if you want to just run a 7B Q4 model, you can do that on a toaster, but if you insist on 7B Q8, you might as well go to 14B Q4 directly. You need to decide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you decide on 14B Q4, that should fit in any GPU with 12GB of VRAM or any device with at least 16GB of unified memory if you can use 12GB just for the AI. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can find a device with a dedicated GPU with 12GB of VRAM and it fits in your budget, then this should be your first option. You mentioned you wanted 20 t/s. That&amp;#39;s not very realistic on a device with unified memory, but it is achievable on a dedicated GPU. If you keep your expectations in check and want to go for unified memory, see no. 4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you get a device with unified memory, get the one with the highest memory bandwidth. This is information that you can find online. Next is the TOPS, which you also can find online, but memory bandwidth is your number one enemy and the first bottleneck. Even if there are no AI benchmarks, you can infer performance based on memory bandwidth. From the ones that you listed there, the M2 Pro has the highest bandwidth I think, but you should double check that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you go for a device with unified memory, don&amp;#39;t be tempted to get one with huge amounts of RAM like 64B or 128GB (I know they won&amp;#39;t fit your budget, but I&amp;#39;m saying it anyway). Right now anything above 14B running on unified RAM, combined with few TOPS, will have huge drops in prompt processing speed. What that means is even if you manage to load a 32B or 70B model and even if it answers your first question reasonably fast, after a few more questions you will have to wait minutes for it to start answering. This might not be a pleasant experience if you are used to cloud AIs that answer instantly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ol&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;TL/DR: If you want to run a smart and fast model, give Qwen 3 4B a try. It will run on anything and I was pleasantly surprised by it. If you want 7B Q8, you might as well jump in the 14B Q4 camp, but that also requires much more expensive hardware. This is the real decision you should make. Don&amp;#39;t go beyond 14B cause you&amp;#39;ll waste your money and you&amp;#39;ll probably not be happy. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;See my post here about my experience running LLMs on a phone.
