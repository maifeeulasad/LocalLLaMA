For me that is the key issue we face.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, I will say the following: Europe should focus on not &lt;em&gt;weakening&lt;/em&gt;, but &lt;em&gt;simplifying&lt;/em&gt; its regulations. Having worked on many, I can&amp;#39;t think of many EU laws I&amp;#39;d like to see repealed, but I can think of many cases where they are convoluted and too complex. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We either need to draft simpler, better laws, or we need to create tools for businesses to feel confident they are compliant more easily.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The GDPR is a great example: many people still don&amp;#39;t understand that you don&amp;#39;t need to ask for cookies if the cookies you are using are &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; for the site to work (login cookies, dark mode preference etc...). There are thousands of commercial services and tools that help people work out if they are GDPR compliant or not, it shouldn&amp;#39;t be that hard.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;","gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"link_id":"t3_1fpmlga","associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":false,"top_awarded_type":null,"unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"treatment_tags":[],"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1fpmlga/llama_32_not_available/lp1dotk/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"report_reasons":null,"created":1727366285,"author_flair_text":null,"collapsed":false,"created_utc":1727366285,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/LocalLLaMA","controversiality":0,"depth":4,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"mod_reports":[],"num_reports":null,"ups":13}}],"before":null}},"user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"lp1crod","banned_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"hanjh","can_mod_post":false,"send_replies":true,"parent_id":"t1_loznso1","score":7,"author_fullname":"t2_7767x","removal_reason":null,"approved_by":null,"mod_note":null,"all_awardings":[],"collapsed":false,"body":"What is your opinion on Mario Draghi’s report?\\n\\n[Report link](https://commission.europa.eu/document/download/97e481fd-2dc3-412d-be4c-f152a8232961_en?filename=The%20future%20of%20European%20competitiveness%20_%20A%20competitiveness%20strategy%20for%20Europe.pdf)\\n\\n“With the world on the cusp of an Al revolution, Europe cannot afford to remain stuck in the “middle technologies and industries” of the previous century.
