Gemini models were seen claiming they were made by Anthropic, all it proves i) lack of data sanitation ii) not giving enough shit to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Because if DeepSeek did want to fix it, they could create a bazillion variations of synthetic data that says it&amp;#39;s DeepSeek just to hone in the identity. Or they could add a server side system prompt hidden even from API, which is most likely how all other self-conscious commercial providers do it. The answer to your question is, it claims it&amp;#39;s OpenAI because DeepSeek doesn&amp;#39;t give a shit to spend manpower and compute to either clean the data, or give it an identity during training.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Sure it hurts the reputation when CNN reports this and people like you constantly bring it up, but again clearly they don&amp;#39;t care enough to fix it (because the fix is not that hard).&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;","removal_reason":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"link_id":"t3_1i5s5hk","associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":false,"top_awarded_type":null,"unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1i5s5hk/openai_sweating_bullets_rn/m87xlvb/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"report_reasons":null,"created":1737403648,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1737403648,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/LocalLLaMA","controversiality":0,"depth":5,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"mod_reports":[],"num_reports":null,"ups":6}},{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_81eyvm","approved_at_utc":null,"author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"awarders":[],"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"LocalLLaMA","author_flair_template_id":null,"distinguished":null,"likes":null,"replies":{"kind":"Listing","data":{"after":null,"dist":null,"modhash":"","geo_filter":"","children":[{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_81eyvm","approved_at_utc":null,"author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"awarders":[],"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"LocalLLaMA","author_flair_template_id":null,"distinguished":null,"likes":null,"replies":"","user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"m88mgva","banned_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Expensive-Apricot-25","can_mod_post":false,"send_replies":true,"parent_id":"t1_m889nom","score":3,"author_fullname":"t2_idqkwio0","approved_by":null,"mod_note":null,"all_awardings":[],"collapsed":false,"body":"yeah, I figured this is what was going on. doesn't make it any less useful, its just a bit disingenuous to advertise it as such","edited":false,"gildings":{},"author_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t1_m88mgva","is_submitter":false,"downs":0,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"body_html":"&lt;div class=\\"md\\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;yeah, I figured this is what was going on. doesn&amp;#39;t make it any less useful, its just a bit disingenuous to advertise it as such&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;","removal_reason":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"link_id":"t3_1i5s5hk","associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":false,"top_awarded_type":null,"unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1i5s5hk/openai_sweating_bullets_rn/m88mgva/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"report_reasons":null,"created":1737410302,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1737410302,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/LocalLLaMA","controversiality":0,"depth":6,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"mod_reports":[],"num_reports":null,"ups":3}}],"before":null}},"user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"m889nom","banned_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"svideo","can_mod_post":false,"send_replies":true,"parent_id":"t1_m87v7rn","score":2,"author_fullname":"t2_1zez9","approved_by":null,"mod_note":null,"all_awardings":[],"body":"The real answer, which I'm sure you're getting at, is that they are using the OAI APIs to generate training data for their models.\\n\\nThis lets you train a model for cheap, but only works when someone else spent that $Ms on training the model you're pulling your synthetic data from.
