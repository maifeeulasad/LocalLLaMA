Let me review what I know. I&amp;#39;ll buy this stock in an attempt to &amp;#39;front run&amp;#39; the trade because I already know what the rest of the company&amp;#39;s trading algorithms are doing.

Why does it say my account has a $2b margin call? Let me look up what happened when other traders have cratered their company to the tune of billions.
