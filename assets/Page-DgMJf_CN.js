Even my backwater dirty pit of East EU, today is nearly unrecognizable, and people themselves feel they are European. 30 years or so and all is gone.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;China has such a start like no other communist country ever had. They are a superpower, highly educated and at the top of world automation and the only thing that makes them&amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; is their autocratic government. That&amp;#39;s a very little thing to go by.&lt;br/&gt;\\nNow imagine if that wasn&amp;#39;t so one day, and they turn open and freedom-loving,  - this would be an absolute western nightmare because there would be just China and everyone else playing third fiddle.&lt;br/&gt;\\nMore so, it would be America worst nightmare. It&amp;#39;s them insisting that China should remain behind the wall.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We can badmouth China, but it&amp;#39;s very circumstantial and it relies on a status quo that we imagine would never change. Haha, I&amp;#39;d say. Ha, ha.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;What China doesn&amp;#39;t have is young people, and I see an alternative very soon when going to China would be the same as it is or used to going to the US for work.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My stinky communist government folded without a fight. In fact they didn&amp;#39;t even fold, they just changed jackets and many became capitalist millionaires because they knew who and how much.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;","gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"distinguished":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":false,"link_id":"t3_1ih3nc6","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ih3nc6/us_bill_proposed_to_jail_people_who_download/mav3rh6/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"report_reasons":null,"created":1738640191,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1738640191,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/LocalLLaMA","controversiality":0,"depth":2,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"mod_reports":[],"num_reports":null,"ups":58}},{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_81eyvm","approved_at_utc":null,"author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"awarders":[],"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"LocalLLaMA","author_flair_template_id":null,"likes":null,"replies":{"kind":"Listing","data":{"after":null,"dist":null,"modhash":"","geo_filter":"","children":[{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_81eyvm","approved_at_utc":null,"author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"awarders":[],"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"LocalLLaMA","author_flair_template_id":null,"likes":null,"replies":{"kind":"Listing","data":{"after":null,"dist":null,"modhash":"","geo_filter":"","children":[{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_81eyvm","approved_at_utc":null,"author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"awarders":[],"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"LocalLLaMA","author_flair_template_id":null,"distinguished":null,"likes":null,"replies":{"kind":"Listing","data":{"after":null,"dist":null,"modhash":"","geo_filter":"","children":[{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_81eyvm","approved_at_utc":null,"author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"awarders":[],"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"LocalLLaMA","author_flair_template_id":null,"distinguished":null,"likes":null,"replies":"","user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"mawa89i","banned_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":false,"author":"False_Grit","can_mod_post":false,"send_replies":true,"parent_id":"t1_mav1b0i","score":4,"author_fullname":"t2_zsvhh","approved_by":null,"mod_note":null,"all_awardings":[],"body":"I
