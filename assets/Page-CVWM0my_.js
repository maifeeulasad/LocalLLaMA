But if you plan to buy hardware for the explicit purpose of playing with LLMs, try to get your hands on a 3090. Because when you eventually want to scale up the \\\\*size\\\\* of the memory, you are very likely going to want the additional memory \\\\*bandwidth\\\\* as well.

If you already have one, great. Use it.\\n\\nRTX 5090 is approaching la-la-land in terms of price/performance for hobbyists. But it \\\\*has\\\\* more memory and better performance.\\n\\nRTX 6000 Blackwell is actually kind of reasonably priced per GB. But at 8-9k+ USD or whatever, it is still way out of reach for most hobbyists/consumers. Beware of power requirements and (still) some software issues/bugs.\\n\\nNvidia DGX Spark (Digits) is definitely interesting. But with \\"only\\" 128GB memory, it sort of falls in the middle. Not really enough memory for the big models, too expensive for the small models. Clustering is an option, send more money. Availability is still up in the air, I think.\\n\\nAMD Strix Halo is a hint at what may come with Medusa Halo (2026) and Gorgon Point (2026-2027). I do not think either of these will come close to match the RTX 3090 in memory bandwidth. But maybe we can get one with 256GB memory? (Not with Strix Halo). And with 256GB, medium sized MoE models may become practical for more of us. (Consumers) We'll see what arrives, and how much it will cost.\\n\\nApple Silicon kind of already offers what the AMD APUs (eventually) may deliver in terms of memory bandwidth and size, but tied to OSX and the Apple universe. And the famous Apple tax. Software support appears to be decent.\\n\\nIntel and AMD are already making stuff which rivals Nvidia's hegemony at the (low end of the) GPU consumer market. The software story is developing, apparently in the right direction. \\n\\nVery high bar for new contenders on the hardware side, I think. No matter who you are, you are likely going to need commitments from one of Samsung, SK Hynix or Micron in order to actually bring stuff to market *at volume*. And unless you can do it at volume, your stuff will be too expensive for consumers.  Qualcomm, Mediatek maybe? Or one of the memory manufacturers themselves. And then, you still need software-support.  Either for your custom accelerator/GPU in relevant libraries, or in Linux for your complete system.\\n\\nIt is also possible someone comes up with something insanely smart in software to substantially lower the computational and/or bandwidth cost. For example by combining system memory and GPU memory with smart offloading of caches/layers, which is already a thing. (Curious about how DGX Spark will perform in this setup.) Or maybe someone figures out how to compress current models to a third with no quality loss, thereby reducing the need for memory. For example.\\n\\nRegular people are still short on *affordable* systems holding at least 256GB or more of memory.

Part of the fundamental problem is less the interests of governments and corporations but the simple economics: the hardware is expensive and you don&amp;#39;t need exclusive access to it (vs say a car or a phone). We&amp;#39;re so connected at this point I&amp;#39;ve found people often struggle with the very &lt;em&gt;idea&lt;/em&gt; of working offline.  Like what would you do with your AI assistant if not shop online or interact, with social media, etc.  What&amp;#39;s the point of spending $500+ on a local machine you have to maintain versus $20/mo at that point.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect that we&amp;#39;ll need some kind of big changes to get to consumer friendly prices, be it in hardware or ML tech. The HBM-Flash that Sandisk seems promising as it could be lower power and cheaper than RAM.
