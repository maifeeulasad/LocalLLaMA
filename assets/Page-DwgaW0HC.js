My main concern is that I dont want a convoluted setup, and the idea of bridging between the miniPC and my PC scares me. Is it possible to achieve this in a scalable and non scary way?\\n\\nBecause I want to future proof this setup relatively, and will add a GPU for local LLMs (I have an old vega 56, is this even worth it to hook up lol) so I think I will opt for this more expensive option: [Beelink | Beelink GTi Ultra Series &amp; EX Pro Docking Station Bundle](https://www.bee-link.com/products/beelink-gti-ex-bundle?variant=46659146285298).

I see people talking about dual GPU setups, does anyone mind telling me when this becomes necessary?I know many people recommend used PC's or building your own tower, but I would be constantly worried about parts failing etc. And with building your own tower my (probably false) assumption is these aren't as optimized for low power consumption, but im sure there are ways to mitigate this if so.
