But agents that actually work don’t try to be JARVIS, not yet. The ones that succeed stick to structured workflows. And that’s not a bad thing.\\n\\nA workflow is just a finite state machine with memory and tool use. LLMs are surprisingly good at that. These agents complete real tasks that used to take human time and effort.\\n\\nRetell AI handles real phone calls for loans and pharmacy refills. It knows what step it’s on, when to speak, when to listen, and when to escalate. Simplify is doing the same for job applications. These are scoped, goal-driven workflows with real impact.\\n\\nBut the real unlock is what happens behind the scenes. Teams use tools like [Maxim AI](https://getmax.im/151yOPq) etc to trace calls, monitor performance, catch regressions, and run evals across multi-step chains. Without that, even good agents start to drift.\\n\\nStructure is the strength.

But agents that actually work don’t try to be JARVIS, not yet. The ones that succeed stick to structured workflows. And that’s not a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A workflow is just a finite state machine with memory and tool use. LLMs are surprisingly good at that. These agents complete real tasks that used to take human time and effort.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Retell AI handles real phone calls for loans and pharmacy refills. It knows what step it’s on, when to speak, when to listen, and when to escalate. Simplify is doing the same for job applications. These are scoped, goal-driven workflows with real impact.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But the real unlock is what happens behind the scenes.
