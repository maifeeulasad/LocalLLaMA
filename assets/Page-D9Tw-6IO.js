Critical Error:&lt;/strong&gt; This is any error that breaks the logical chain of the proof. This includes both &lt;strong&gt;logical fallacies&lt;/strong&gt; (e.g., claiming that ‚Äò$A &amp;gt; B$, $C &amp;gt; D$‚Äô implies ‚Äò$A - C &amp;gt; B - D$‚Äô) and &lt;strong&gt;factual errors&lt;/strong&gt; (e.g., a calculation error like ‚Äò$2 + 3 = 6$‚Äô).\\n\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Procedure:&lt;/strong&gt;\\n\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Explain the specific error and state that it &lt;strong&gt;invalidates the current line of reasoning&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Do NOT check any further steps that rely on this error.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;You MUST, however, scan the rest of the solution to identify and verify any fully independent parts. For example, if a proof is split into multiple cases, an error in one case does not prevent you from checking the other cases.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;b.
