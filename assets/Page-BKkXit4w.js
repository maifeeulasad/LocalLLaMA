When you do something like that, it's like you don't really care about the ideas to even write about them. I would rather read a post from a person who doesn't know English very well than one straight out of an AI.\\n\\nBtw, It's not about rejecting Al outright, I'm FINE with AI writing emails at work, or whatever, because in those places it's more about getting the task done in the quickest time possible.\\n\\nYou mention that people \\"stop engaging with the actual ideas being shared\\" when being presented with AI content. And why should they? Instead of getting a meaningful reply from a human, they get a shallow reply from an algorithm. No creativity, just what's in the training data. To many people, there's no \\"actual Ideas\\" in this algorithm like you say, just a word predictor.
