You would be surprised to learn that medicine is mostly algorithms. Most hospitals/treatment teams have guidelines that dictate how to diagnose then treat from H&amp;P/assessment. The treatment stuff especially can be easily trained in an LLM. \\n\\n\\nI don't think LLMs are the best way to diagnose, but they can be the best way to form a treatment plan. Diagnosing is a bit of an art form that requires a lot of knowledge and experience, but treating requires a ton of data for the most effective route. LLMs can take in a massive context of data, history, allergies, genetics, socioeconomic situation, lab values, etc and make a treatment plan that actually works for the patient. Think, why this medication and not this medication?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI see LLMs working well on managing patients, but we are ways away from LLMs doing critical management.
