My statement honestly did simplify how difficult it is for the average person to recognize LLM-written content if they don&amp;#39;t have a lot of experience with it. I am biased because I&amp;#39;ve spent hundreds of hours working with them.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;However, I was thinking that universities could provide professors mandatory training on how to effectively navigate potentially receiving AI-written assignments from students -- such as requiring students to write their assignments on an online editor (Google Docs/Office 365) or incrementally upload their own work to prove that the work is their own. I&amp;#39;m aware that it&amp;#39;s relatively trivial to work around, but if it becomes a standardized policy then it could potentially reduce ambiguity on whether content was written by an LLM. I can&amp;#39;t think of a better solution in terms of false positives/negatives with current technology.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;","gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"distinguished":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":false,"link_id":"t3_1lnrd1t","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1lnrd1t/you_can_just_rl_a_model_to_beat_any_ai_detectors/n0hnylc/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"report_reasons":null,"created":1751239972,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1751239972,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/LocalLLaMA","controversiality":0,"depth":2,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"mod_reports":[],"num_reports":null,"ups":2}},{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_81eyvm","approved_at_utc":null,"author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"awarders":[],"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"LocalLLaMA","author_flair_template_id":null,"likes":null,"replies":"","user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"n0huidh","banned_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"CoUsT","can_mod_post":false,"send_replies":true,"parent_id":"t1_n0hlsf2","score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_fj71z","removal_reason":null,"approved_by":null,"mod_note":null,"all_awardings":[],"body":"That's what AI would say to defend itself.
