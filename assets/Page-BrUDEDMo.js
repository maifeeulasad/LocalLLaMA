It uses academic search whenever it looks for papers and publications and escalates into deep search when standard fails.\\nOther models failed, ended up calling the same function again and again.\\nKeep in mind that smolagents allows intermediate planning which does a recap after x iterations which in my opinion greatly helps to prevent loops aswell.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The second example is a tool-function i wrote for reading files or large texts with the help of an additional llm (i use phi4 for that) The agentic llm needs to formulate a question on what kind of information it needs from the file/text. The other llm will process and summarize the content in regards to the query. Devstral is able to derive meaningful querys for the llm like &amp;quot;gather information about the author&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;extract further weblinks&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;While not being perfect i did not expect such a small llm to even handle this at all.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;","gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"link_id":"t3_1lqi863","associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":false,"top_awarded_type":null,"unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"treatment_tags":[],"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1lqi863/deepswepreview_590_on_swebenchverified_with/n15s5ex/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"report_reasons":null,"created":1751563105,"author_flair_text":null,"collapsed":false,"created_utc":1751563105,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/LocalLLaMA","controversiality":0,"depth":4,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"mod_reports":[],"num_reports":null,"ups":2}}],"before":null}},"user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"n15oepp","banned_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Zc5Gwu","can_mod_post":false,"send_replies":true,"parent_id":"t1_n13csmn","score":2,"author_fullname":"t2_67qrvlir","removal_reason":null,"approved_by":null,"mod_note":null,"all_awardings":[],"collapsed":false,"body":"Just to offer a counter opinion.
