                      "body": "Here's the breakdown of why the word is **Dog**:\n\n---\n\n## Analyzing the Clues\n\nLet's list the words and their letters:\n\n* **cat**: c, a, t\n* **dog**: d, o, g\n* **has**: h, a, s\n* **max**: m, a, x\n* **dim**: d, i, m\n* **tag**: t, a, g\n\n---\n\n## Albert's Deduction\n\nAlbert immediately knows the word. This is the crucial first clue. If Albert's letter appeared in more than one word, he wouldn't know it instantly. Therefore, Albert must have a letter that is **unique** to one of the words.\n\nLet's look for unique letters:\n\n* **c** (only in cat)\n* **o** (only in dog)\n* **h** (only in has)\n* **x** (only in max)\n* **i** (only in dim)\n* **g** (in dog and tag – not unique enough for Albert)\n\nSo, Albert's letter could be 'c', 'o', 'h', 'x', or 'i'. This means the word could be \"cat\", \"dog\", \"has\", \"max\", or \"dim\".\n\n---\n\n## Bernard's Deduction\n\nBernard thinks, then says \"Yes.\" This means Bernard's letter *could* be in more than one of the remaining possible words, but based on Albert's \"yes,\" he can now deduce the word.\n\nLet's consider the possible words after Albert's revelation: \"cat\", \"dog\", \"has\", \"max\", \"dim\".\n\nIf Bernard's letter were 'a' for example, he would know that Albert's letter could have been 'c', 'h', 'm', or 't' (if the 't' wasn't duplicated). But he knows Albert's letter *was* unique. So, Bernard's \"yes\" tells us something about the distribution of letters in the remaining possibilities.\n\nConsider the letters in the remaining words:\n\n* cat: c, a, t\n* dog: d, o, g\n* has: h, a, s\n* max: m, a, x\n* dim: d, i, m\n\nIf Bernard has 'a', he still couldn't know the word, because 'a' is in \"cat,\" \"has,\" and \"max.\"\n\nBernard's \"yes\" means that for *any* letter he could have, given Albert's knowledge, he would be able to uniquely identify the word.\n\nThe key here is that if the word were \"cat,\" \"has,\" or \"max,\" and Bernard had 'a', he wouldn't know the word. This eliminates any words that share a common letter with another potential word if that common letter isn't unique to one of the *remaining* words once Albert's letter has been accounted for.\n\nIf the word were **dog**, Bernard's letter would be 'd', 'o', or 'g'.\n* If Bernard had 'o', he'd know it was 'dog' (as 'o' is unique).\n* If Bernard had 'd', he'd know it was 'dog' (as 'd' is in 'dog' and 'dim', but if Albert knew the word, it couldn't be 'dim' because 'd' and 'm' are not unique to 'dim' only, while 'i' is unique to 'dim'. However, if Albert had 'i', it would be 'dim' - if he had 'd', he would not know, if he had 'm', he would not know - Albert's 'yes' eliminates 'd' and 'm' from consideration for his letter).\n* If Bernard had 'g', he'd know it was 'dog' (as 'g' is in 'dog' and 'tag', but Albert would have instantly known if his letter was 't', making it 'tag'. If Albert had 'g', he wouldn't have known, so 'g' must be the letter that leads Bernard to 'dog').\n\nThe only way Bernard can say \"yes\" is if his letter, in combination with Albert's knowledge, eliminates all other possibilities. This happens when the word is **dog**.\n\nIf the word were \"cat\", \"has\", \"max\", or \"dim\", Bernard, seeing his letter 'a' (which is shared), 't', 's', 'm', or 'd', would not be able to uniquely identify the word because of the other shared letters.\n\n---\n\n## Cheryl's Deduction\n\nCheryl also thinks, then says \"Yes.\" This confirms the deduction. If the word were \"cat,\" \"has,\" \"max,\" or \"dim,\" there would be scenarios where Cheryl wouldn't know.\n\nThe only scenario where all three can deduce the word is **dog**.\n\nLet's trace it back to \"dog\":\n\n* **Albert's letter: 'o'**. He immediately knows the word is \"dog\" because 'o' is unique to \"dog.\" (If Albert had 'd' or 'g', he wouldn't know the word initially, as 'd' is also in 'dim' and 'g' is also in 'tag'. So Albert *must* have had 'o'.)\n\n* **Bernard's letter: 'd' or 'g'**. Since Albert knew the word, Bernard now knows it's \"dog.\"\n    * If Bernard had 'd', he knows Albert must have had 'o' (since 'd' is in 'dog' and 'dim', but if Albert had 'i' for 'dim', he would have known the word was 'dim').\n    * If Bernard had 'g', he knows Albert must have had 'o' (since 'g' is in 'dog' and 'tag', but if Albert had 't' for 'tag', he would have known the word was 'tag').\n\n* **Cheryl's letter: The remaining letter ('g' or 'd')**. Given that Albert and Bernard both figured it out, Cheryl can also deduce that the word must be \"dog.\"\n\nThe crucial step is Albert's immediate \"yes,\" which implies his letter is unique to *one* of the original words. The only scenario where the subsequent \"yes\" answers from Bernard and Cheryl consistently lead to a single word is when the word is \"dog\" and Albert's unique letter was 'o'. If Albert had, say, 'c' (for \"cat\"), Bernard and Cheryl wouldn't necessarily be able to narrow it down further if their letters were, for instance, 'a' or 't' (which are shared letters).\n\nTherefore, the word is **Dog**.",

This is the crucial first clue. If Albert&amp;#39;s letter appeared in more than one word, he wouldn&amp;#39;t know it instantly. Therefore, Albert must have a letter that is &lt;strong&gt;unique&lt;/strong&gt; to one of the words.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s look for unique letters:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;c&lt;/strong&gt; (only in cat)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;o&lt;/strong&gt; (only in dog)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;h&lt;/strong&gt; (only in has)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;x&lt;/strong&gt; (only in max)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;i&lt;/strong&gt; (only in dim)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;g&lt;/strong&gt; (in dog and tag – not unique enough for Albert)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, Albert&amp;#39;s letter could be &amp;#39;c&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;o&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;h&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;x&amp;#39;, or &amp;#39;i&amp;#39;. This means the word could be &amp;quot;cat&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;dog&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;has&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;max&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;dim&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Bernard&amp;#39;s Deduction&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bernard thinks, then says &amp;quot;Yes.&amp;quot; This means Bernard&amp;#39;s letter &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be in more than one of the remaining possible words, but based on Albert&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;yes,&amp;quot; he can now deduce the word.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s consider the possible words after Albert&amp;#39;s revelation: &amp;quot;cat&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;dog&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;has&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;max&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;dim&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If Bernard&amp;#39;s letter were &amp;#39;a&amp;#39; for example, he would know that Albert&amp;#39;s letter could have been &amp;#39;c&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;h&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;m&amp;#39;, or &amp;#39;t&amp;#39; (if the &amp;#39;t&amp;#39; wasn&amp;#39;t duplicated). But he knows Albert&amp;#39;s letter &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; unique. So, Bernard&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; tells us something about the distribution of letters in the remaining possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Consider the letters in the remaining words:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;cat: c, a, t&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;dog: d, o, g&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;has: h, a, s&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;max: m, a, x&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;dim: d, i, m&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If Bernard has &amp;#39;a&amp;#39;, he still couldn&amp;#39;t know the word, because &amp;#39;a&amp;#39; is in &amp;quot;cat,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;has,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;max.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bernard&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; means that for &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; letter he could have, given Albert&amp;#39;s knowledge, he would be able to uniquely identify the word.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The key here is that if the word were &amp;quot;cat,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;has,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;max,&amp;quot; and Bernard had &amp;#39;a&amp;#39;, he wouldn&amp;#39;t know the word. This eliminates any words that share a common letter with another potential word if that common letter isn&amp;#39;t unique to one of the &lt;em&gt;remaining&lt;/em&gt; words once Albert&amp;#39;s letter has been accounted for.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the word were &lt;strong&gt;dog&lt;/strong&gt;, Bernard&amp;#39;s letter would be &amp;#39;d&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;o&amp;#39;, or &amp;#39;g&amp;#39;.\n* If Bernard had &amp;#39;o&amp;#39;, he&amp;#39;d know it was &amp;#39;dog&amp;#39; (as &amp;#39;o&amp;#39; is unique).\n* If Bernard had &amp;#39;d&amp;#39;, he&amp;#39;d know it was &amp;#39;dog&amp;#39; (as &amp;#39;d&amp;#39; is in &amp;#39;dog&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;dim&amp;#39;, but if Albert knew the word, it couldn&amp;#39;t be &amp;#39;dim&amp;#39; because &amp;#39;d&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;m&amp;#39; are not unique to &amp;#39;dim&amp;#39; only, while &amp;#39;i&amp;#39; is unique to &amp;#39;dim&amp;#39;. However, if Albert had &amp;#39;i&amp;#39;, it would be &amp;#39;dim&amp;#39; - if he had &amp;#39;d&amp;#39;, he would not know, if he had &amp;#39;m&amp;#39;, he would not know - Albert&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;yes&amp;#39; eliminates &amp;#39;d&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;m&amp;#39; from consideration for his letter).\n* If Bernard had &amp;#39;g&amp;#39;, he&amp;#39;d know it was &amp;#39;dog&amp;#39; (as &amp;#39;g&amp;#39; is in &amp;#39;dog&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;tag&amp;#39;, but Albert would have instantly known if his letter was &amp;#39;t&amp;#39;, making it &amp;#39;tag&amp;#39;. If Albert had &amp;#39;g&amp;#39;, he wouldn&amp;#39;t have known, so &amp;#39;g&amp;#39; must be the letter that leads Bernard to &amp;#39;dog&amp;#39;).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only way Bernard can say &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; is if his letter, in combination with Albert&amp;#39;s knowledge, eliminates all other possibilities. This happens when the word is &lt;strong&gt;dog&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the word were &amp;quot;cat&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;has&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;max&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;dim&amp;quot;, Bernard, seeing his letter &amp;#39;a&amp;#39; (which is shared), &amp;#39;t&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;s&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;m&amp;#39;, or &amp;#39;d&amp;#39;, would not be able to uniquely identify the word because of the other shared letters.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Cheryl&amp;#39;s Deduction&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cheryl also thinks, then says &amp;quot;Yes.&amp;quot; This confirms the deduction. If the word were &amp;quot;cat,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;has,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;max,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;dim,&amp;quot; there would be scenarios where Cheryl wouldn&amp;#39;t know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only scenario where all three can deduce the word is &lt;strong&gt;dog&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s trace it back to &amp;quot;dog&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Albert&amp;#39;s letter: &amp;#39;o&amp;#39;&lt;/strong&gt;. He immediately knows the word is &amp;quot;dog&amp;quot; because &amp;#39;o&amp;#39; is unique to &amp;quot;dog.&amp;quot; (If Albert had &amp;#39;d&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;g&amp;#39;, he wouldn&amp;#39;t know the word initially, as &amp;#39;d&amp;#39; is also in &amp;#39;dim&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;g&amp;#39; is also in &amp;#39;tag&amp;#39;. So Albert &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; have had &amp;#39;o&amp;#39;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bernard&amp;#39;s letter: &amp;#39;d&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;g&amp;#39;&lt;/strong&gt;. Since Albert knew the word, Bernard now knows it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;dog.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If Bernard had &amp;#39;d&amp;#39;, he knows Albert must have had &amp;#39;o&amp;#39; (since &amp;#39;d&amp;#39; is in &amp;#39;dog&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;dim&amp;#39;, but if Albert had &amp;#39;i&amp;#39; for &amp;#39;dim&amp;#39;, he would have known the word was &amp;#39;dim&amp;#39;).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If Bernard had &amp;#39;g&amp;#39;, he knows Albert must have had &amp;#39;o&amp;#39; (since &amp;#39;g&amp;#39; is in &amp;#39;dog&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;tag&amp;#39;, but if Albert had &amp;#39;t&amp;#39; for &amp;#39;tag&amp;#39;, he would have known the word was &amp;#39;tag&amp;#39;).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cheryl&amp;#39;s letter: The remaining letter (&amp;#39;g&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;d&amp;#39;)&lt;/strong&gt;. Given that Albert and Bernard both figured it out, Cheryl can also deduce that the word must be &amp;quot;dog.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The crucial step is Albert&amp;#39;s immediate &amp;quot;yes,&amp;quot; which implies his letter is unique to &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; of the original words. The only scenario where the subsequent &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; answers from Bernard and Cheryl consistently lead to a single word is when the word is &amp;quot;dog&amp;quot; and Albert&amp;#39;s unique letter was &amp;#39;o&amp;#39;. If Albert had, say, &amp;#39;c&amp;#39; (for &amp;quot;cat&amp;quot;), Bernard and Cheryl wouldn&amp;#39;t necessarily be able to narrow it down further if their letters were, for instance, &amp;#39;a&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;t&amp;#39; (which are shared letters).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the word is &lt;strong&gt;Dog&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
