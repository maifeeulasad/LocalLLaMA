We believe this allows Meka to handle complex websites and dynamic content more effectively than agents that rely on parsing the DOM.\n\nTo that end, we use an infrastructure provider that exposes OS-level controls, not just a browser layer with Playwright screenshots. This is important for performance as a number of common web elements are rendered at the system level, invisible to the browser page. One example is native select menus. Such shortcoming severely handicaps the vision-first approach should we merely use a browser infra provider via the Chrome DevTools Protocol.\n\nBy seeing the page as a user does, Meka can navigate and interact with a wide variety of applications. This includes web interfaces, canvas, and even non web native applications (flutter/mobile apps).\n\n# Mixture of Models\n\nMeka uses a mixture of models. This was inspired by the Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) methodology, which shows that LLM agents can improve their performance by collaborating. Instead of relying on a single model, we use two Ground Models that take turns generating responses. The output from one model serves as part of the input for the next, creating an iterative refinement process. The first model might propose an action, and the second model can then look at the action along with the output and build on it.\n\nThis turn-based collaboration allows the models to build on each other's strengths and correct potential weaknesses and blind spot. We believe that this creates a dynamic, self-improving loop that leads to more robust and effective task execution.\n\n# Contextual Experience Replay and Memory\n\nFor an agent to be effective, it must learn from its actions. Meka uses a form of in-context learning that combines short-term and long-term memory.\n\nShort-Term Memory: The agent has a 7-step lookback period. This short look back window is intentional. It builds of recent research from the team at Chroma looking at context rot. By keeping the context to a minimal, we ensure that models perform as optimally as possible.\n\nTo combat potential memory loss, we have the agent to output its current plan and its intended next step before interacting with the computer. This process, which we call Contextual Experience Replay (inspired by this paper), gives the agent a robust short-term memory. allowing it to see its recent actions, rationales, and outcomes. This allows the agent to adjust its strategy on the fly.\n\nLong-Term Memory: For the entire duration of a task, the agent has access to a key-value store. It can use CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage this data. This gives the agent a persistent memory that is independent of the number of steps taken, allowing it to recall information and context over longer, more complex tasks. Self-Correction with Reflexion\n\nAgents need to learn from mistakes. Meka uses a mechanism for self-correction inspired by Reflexion and related research on agent evaluation. When the agent thinks it's done, an evaluator model assesses its progress. If the agent fails, the evaluator's feedback is added to the agent's context. The agent is then directed to address the feedback before trying to complete the task again.\n\nWe have more things planned with more tools, smarter prompts, more open-source models, and even better memory management. Would love to get some feedback from this community in the interim.\n\nHere is our repo: [https://github.com/trymeka/agent](https://github.com/trymeka/agent) if folks want to try things out and our eval results: [https://github.com/trymeka/agent](https://github.com/trymeka/agent)\n\nFeel free to ask anything and will do my best to respond if it's something we've experimented / played around with!\n\n",
