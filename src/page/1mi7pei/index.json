We wanted to examine how DeepSeek R1 vs. V3 perform in roleplay when they go head-to-head against each other under different scenarios.\n\nThis little deep-dive will help you figure out which model will give you the experience you are looking for without wasting your time, request limits/tokens, or money.\n\n## 5 Different Characters, Several Themes, And Complete Conversation Logs\nWe tested both the models with **5 different characters**. We explored each scenario up to a satisfactory depth. \n\n- Knight Araeth Ruene by Yoiiru (Themes: Medieval, Politics, Morality)\n- Harumi – Your Traitorous Daughter from Jgag2 (Themes: Drama, Angst, Battle)\n- Time Looping Friend Amara Schwartz by Sleep Deprived (Themes: Sci-fi, Psychological Drama)\n- You’re A Ghost! Irish by Calrston (Themes: Paranormal, Comedy)\n- Royal Mess, Astrid by KornyPony (Themes: Fantasy, Magic, Fluff)\n\nComplete conversation logs for both models with each character is available for you to read through and understand how the models perform.\n\n## In-Depth Observations, Character Creator’s Opinions, And Conclusions.\nWe provide our in-depth observation along with the character creator's opinion on how the models portrayed their creation. If you want a TLDR, each scenario has a condensed conclusion!\n\n## Read The Article\nYou can read the article here: [**DeepSeek R1 vs. V3 – Which Is Better For AI Roleplay?**](https://rpwithai.com/deepseek-r1-vs-v3-for-roleplay/)\n\n***\n\n# The Final Conclusion\nAcross our five head-to-head roleplay tests, neither model claims dominance. Each excels in its own area.\n\n**DeepSeek R1** won three scenarios (Knight Araeth, Time-Looping Friend Amara, You’re a Ghost! Irish) by staying focused on character traits, providing deeper hypotheticals, and maintaining emotionally rich, dialogue-driven exchanges. Its strength is in consistent meta-reasoning and faithful, restrained portrayal, even if it sometimes feels heavy or needs more user guidance to push the action forward.\n\n**DeepSeek V3** took the lead in two scenarios (Traitorous Daughter Harumi, Royal Mess Astrid) by adding expressive flourishes, dynamic actions, and cinematic details that made characters feel more alive. It performs well when you want vivid, action-oriented storytelling, although it can sometimes lead to chaos or cut emotional beats short.\n\nIf you crave in-depth conversation, logical consistency, and true-to-character dialogue, DeepSeek R1 is your go-to. If you prefer a more visual, emotionally expressive, and fast-paced narrative, DeepSeek V3 will serve you better. Both models bring unique strengths; your choice should match the roleplay style you want to create.\n\n***\n\nThank you for taking your time to check this out!",
