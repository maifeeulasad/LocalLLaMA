And here I am !\n\nMost of what you'll see is written by claude so it might contain some egg shell, it did my best to keep him on track and prevent mistake, and i read most of it's ouputs, it wasn't a yolo thing.\n\n\n\nSo, here it is [https://github.com/kkuette/diffusion-thought-tensor](https://github.com/kkuette/diffusion-thought-tensor) enjoy.",
