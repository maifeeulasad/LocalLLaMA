The average duration of human task a model can reliably do is doubling every 7 months.\n* **The economics of foundation models are confusing** – OpenAI &amp; Anthropic are showing truly unprecedented growth, accelerating at $B+ of annual revenue. But, end-to-end training costs for frontier models near $500M, and the typical model becomes obsolete within 3 weeks of launch thanks to competition &amp; open source convergence.\n* **Just like the smartest humans, the smartest AI will “think before it speaks”** – Reasoning models trained to think before responding likely represent a new scaling law — but training them requires significant advances in post-training, including reinforcement learning &amp; reward models. Post-training may become more important than pre-training.\n* **AI has now infiltrated almost all specialist professions** – From engineers and accountants to designers and lawyers, AI copilots and agents are now tackling high-value tasks in virtually all knowledge worker domains.\n* **Agents finally work, but we are early in understanding how to build AI products** – Agents have finally hit the mainstream, but design patterns &amp; system architectures for AI products are still extremely early.\n* **“AI-native” organizations will look very different** – Flatter teams of capable generalists will become the norm as generative AI lessens the value of specialized skills.
