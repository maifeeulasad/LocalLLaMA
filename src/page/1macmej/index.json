I have a 12GB VRAM RTX 3060 GPU with Ollama running in a docker container.\n\nI haven't done extensive research to be honest, but I did try searching for a bit in general.

If you want full local, you need both.\n\nFor model, I hate to be a downer but even the best locally available models are generally considered inferior to Claude.  The good ones are pretty good though, but require ~512GB of RAM to run.  Or VRAM, but that's about $50k minimum so I do realistically mean RAM, preferably on a big server / threadripper CPU.  Of course, you can run any model at terribly slow speeds so you can try some stuff regardless of what your CPU/RAM is, though expect to _wait_...\n\nIf you want to mess around [Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct) might be your best bet, though Qwen is going to release v3 smaller models next week which hopefully will have a new small one like that.  That said IDK how good a small one like that will be for a CLI tool versus a chat-type interface (where it's already only marginal).\n\nAnyways, I haven't used Claude Code's CLI but you could try [qwen-code](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code) which is a fork of Google's gemini-cli which I've heard some good things about and is apparently fairly similar.  IDK if it'll work with the model I gave you since it's really meant for [Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct) though _hopefully_ it'll also work with the aforementioned to-be-released models.\n\nRunning that at a ... meaningful speed would require a minimum of 128GB of CPU RAM.  Your 3060 would be okay as a GPU, though, since the model is so huge you basically just put some calculations on it and 12GB is enough to get started.  If you have 128GB of DDR5, I _think_ I've seen people report something like 4-5 token/s - dunno if that means anything to you though.",
