Results are somehow unexpected.\n\nQuestion: There are three circles of radius 1, 2 and 3 tangent to each other. Find the area enclosed by their touching arcs.  \nCorrect answer: 0.464256\n\no4-min - correct  \nQwen3-235B-A22B-Thinknig-2507 - correct  \nQwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507 - incorrect (5.536)  \nQwen3-32B - incorrect (5.536)  \nKimi-K2 - correct  \nDeepSeek-V3-0324 correct  \nDeepSeek-R1-0528 and Nemotron-Super-49B both gave the same incorrect answer (0.7358)  \nNemotron-Super-49B without reasoning - very incorrect (6 - 6 \\\\pi &lt; 0)\n\nAll models were used from their respective providers. It seems that models that failed had the right answer in their COT in one way or another, but failed to understand what they were asked in terms of actual geometry. The answer 5.536 is actually the sum of segments' area and is one step away from the right answer, which is 6 - 5.536 = 0.464. There are several unexpected results for me here:\n\n1. DeepSeek-R1 overthought the problem and managed to fail this fairly simple question although in COT it had the correct idea how to calculate: it as an area of triangle formed be center of circles minus areas of segments of each circle inside triangle.\n2. Kimi-K2 and DeepSeek-V3-0324 are very smart even without reasoning.\n3. Nemotron reasoning comes from DeepSeek distilation process.\n4. Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507 output was so long as if it was a thinking model.\n5. Qwen3-32B is very capable model for its size, but you should go through all its COT to see if the right answer is burred somewhere there.\n\nOverall, based on these observations I think the right way to approach an analytical problem is to use first capable non-reasoning model and if it fails use capable thinking model then.\n\nPS: I am not a native speaker and may be the problem is in my formulation of the question. Still smart models understood what I really meant.",
