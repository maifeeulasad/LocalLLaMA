            "selftext": "I remember when vLLM was just a narrowly specialized tool which almost nobody used. Everyone was using Ollama (basically a wrapper for llama.cpp which turns it into an OpenAI-capable API and adds some easy tools for downloading models), or using llama.cpp directly.\n\nBut I've been seeing more and more people using vLLM everywhere now, and have been hearing that they have a very efficient architecture that increases processing speed, has more efficient parallel processing, better response time, efficient batching that runs multiple requests at the same time, multi-GPU support, supports LoRAs without bloating memory usage, has way lower VRAM usage when using long contexts, etc.\n\nAnd it also implements the OpenAI API.\n\nSo my question is: Should I just uninstall Ollama/llama.cpp and switch to vLLM full-time? Seems like that's where it's at now.\n\n\\---\n\nEdit: Okay here's a summary:\n\n* vLLM: Extremely well optimized code. Made for enterprise, where latency and throughput is the highest importance. Only loads a single model per instance. Uses a lot of modern GPU features for speedup, so it doesn't work on older GPUs. It has great multi-GPU support (spreading model weights across the GPUs and acting as if they're one GPU with combined VRAM). Uses very fast caching techniques (its major innovation being a paged KV cache which massively reduces VRAM usage for long prompt contexts). It pre-allocates 90% of your VRAM to itself for speed regardless of how small the model is. It does NOT support VRAM offloading or CPU-split inference. It's designed to keep the ENTIRE model in VRAM. So if you are able to fit the models in your VRAM, then vLLM is better, but since it was made for dedicated enterprise servers it has the downside that you have to restart vLLM if you want to change model.\n* Ollama: Can change models on the fly and automatically unloads the old model and loads the new one. It works on pretty much any GPU. It's able to do split inference and RAM offloading so that models which don't fit on the GPU will use offloading and still be able to run even if you have too little VRAM. And it's also very easy for beginners.\n\nSo for casual users, Ollama is a big winner. Just start and go. Whereas vLLM only sounds worth it if you mostly use one model, and you're able to fit it in VRAM, and you really wanna push its performance higher.\n\nWith this in mind, I'll stay on Ollama and only consider vLLM if I see a model that I really want to optimize and use a lot. So I'll use Ollama for general model testing and multi-model swapping, and will only use vLLM if there's something I end up using a lot and think it's worth the extra hassle of using vLLM to speed it up a bit.\n\nAs for answering my own original topic question: No. vLLM has not \"made Ollama redundant now\". vLLM has actually \\*always\\* made Ollama redundant from day 1. Because they serve two totally different purposes. Ollama is way better and way more convenient for most home users. And vLLM is way better for servers and people who have tons of VRAM and want the fastest inference. That's it. Two totally different user groups. I'm personally mostly in the Ollama group with my 24 GB VRAM and hobbyist setup.\n\n\\---\n\nEdit: To put some actual numbers on it, I found a nice post where someone did a detailed benchmark of vLLM vs Ollama. The result was simple: **vLLM was up to 3.23x faster than Ollama in an inference throughput/concurrency test:** [https://robert-mcdermott.medium.com/performance-vs-practicality-a-comparison-of-vllm-and-ollama-104acad250fd](https://robert-mcdermott.medium.com/performance-vs-practicality-a-comparison-of-vllm-and-ollama-104acad250fd)\n\nBut for home users, Ollama is better at pretty much everything else that an average home user needs.",
