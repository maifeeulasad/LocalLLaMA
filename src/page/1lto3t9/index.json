            "selftext": "Abstract\n\nWe propose a novel inference-time optimization method for resource-constrained deployment of large language models (LLMs), enabling high-quality output from models too large to fit into a single consumer-grade GPU. This technique—Prompt-Guided Dynamic Slicing and Insertion Point Resolution (PG-DSIR)—leverages coarse inference from a quantized or low-parameter proxy model to define a hyperspherical subregion of the solution space. This subregion is then mapped onto the full-precision model, from which only the minimal required model weights are dynamically loaded and computed.\n\nTo reduce redundant early-layer computation and maximize efficiency, PG-DSIR determines a static insertion point within the full model’s architecture where the low-precision representation aligns most closely with a hidden state of the larger model. This alignment is determined through cosine similarity across the hidden states of the full model, enabling direct embedding injection midstream. A lightweight corrective module (e.g., a LoRA or learned delta predictor) bridges the precision gap between the coarse embedding and the ground truth embedding, improving alignment and preserving output quality.\n\nOur technique draws conceptual inspiration from hybrid latent-space workflows in image generation (e.g., LCM + SD schedulers) and departs from traditional quantization, distillation, or Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) routing by enabling continuous, per-inference specialization of the model footprint. The resulting system provides a principled and geometry-driven pathway to real-time inference using ultra-large models on modest hardware, dramatically reducing both VRAM usage and computational overhead.\n\n\n---\n\nIntroduction: Toward Focused Large-Model Inference via Geometric Slicing and Targeted Insertion\n\nLarge Language Models have achieved unprecedented capability at the cost of significant resource demands. Models such as Meta’s LLaMA 3 70B, for example, require over 140 GB of VRAM to run in full precision—placing them well beyond reach for consumer or even prosumer-grade hardware. Traditional strategies to reduce inference cost include quantization, distillation, parameter pruning, and expert routing. These techniques, while effective, trade off flexibility, output fidelity, or require extensive fine-tuning.\n\nWe introduce Prompt-Guided Dynamic Slicing and Insertion Point Resolution (PG-DSIR) as an alternative strategy, rooted in a geometric understanding of latent representations. Our method operates under the key insight that inference can be reconceived not as a global pass through the entire parameter space of a model, but as a locally focused traversal through a high-dimensional latent graph—constrained by an informed estimate of the solution space.\n\n1. Conceptual Overview\n\nThe method begins with a prompt passed to a smaller, quantized proxy model (e.g., 7B), which produces a low-precision embedding in a shared latent space. Although this representation lacks the full nuance of a high-precision model, it defines a directional “search vector” within the solution space. By interpreting this vector as a hypersphere in the full model’s higher-precision latent space, we delimit the relevant solution subregion for the current prompt.\n\nRather than processing the entire 70B model, we instead extract and load only the parameter subset required to refine that coarse embedding within its solution subregion. This step parallels the logic of MoE routing but bypasses the need for discrete experts or static routing logic, instead constructing a dynamically sliced micro-expert composed only of what the full model knows about the specific problem space defined by the prompt.\n\n2. Insertion Point Resolution\n\nTo avoid recomputation of early transformer blocks—often the most computationally expensive—we perform embedding handoff into the full model at an internal layer corresponding to the hidden state most similar to the coarse embedding. This “insertion point” is found by analyzing cosine similarity between the proxy embedding and the hidden states of the full model when run on the same prompt. Importantly, this mapping is prompt-agnostic and only needs to be computed once per proxy/full model pair.\n\n3. Precision Bridging and Correction\n\nEven with accurate slicing and entry point resolution, discrepancies will remain between the proxy embedding and the full model’s expected hidden state. We address this through a corrective module—either a learned LoRA, linear mapping, or shallow neural delta predictor—trained on embedding pairs generated via dual model evaluation on a large prompt corpus. This allows us to cleanly bridge the two latent spaces with negligible overhead.\n\n4. Implications\n\nThe proposed PG-DSIR pipeline enables inference from large-scale models like LLaMA 3 70B or Mixtral on consumer GPUs (e.g., RTX 3060–4090), significantly reducing required VRAM and compute without necessitating global model transformation. Moreover, this method maintains the full model’s capabilities and expressiveness, differing from quantization approaches that often suffer from irrecoverable degradation.\n\n\n---\n\nConclusion\n\nBy treating inference as a navigational process through high-dimensional geometry, PG-DSIR transforms the challenge of large model execution into a targeted optimization problem. We believe this technique can unlock a new era of ultra-large model accessibility, enabling research, development, and deployment of frontier models on commodity hardware—without compromising capability.\n",
