MCP is the latest hype and there’s lots of examples so I would explore if I can download/copy something first. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once it’s outputting something then I would optimize for correctness. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would hack together an evaluation tool that can test the system end to end. I would use this tool to quickly evaluate if changes are getting the system to be more reliable or worse. No component in the system is sacred and I would consider any changes that met my quality measurements. Fwiw: maintainability, simplicity are two of my quality measurements.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
