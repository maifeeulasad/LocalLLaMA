Wait for the 50 super series, they are supposedly doing 5070's with 18gb vram  i suspect will be in the 550 range.        The B60 is going to be damn near impossible to find, and even though I haven't tried it on that GPU but I have tried A770 and it was sad how slow that was on LLMs.     NVidia really is the best with ROCm a very distant second and Intel pretty much not even on the map.    As for what model i would keep in my dooms day... right now GLM 4.5 hands down is the best",

If you are playing around and just want something decent, get Mistral Small 24b it can run on lower end hardware.    I have MI50s and they are fun to play with but really not practical.   Wait for the 50 super series, they are supposedly doing 5070&amp;#39;s with 18gb vram  i suspect will be in the 550 range.        The B60 is going to be damn near impossible to find, and even though I haven&amp;#39;t tried it on that GPU but I have tried A770 and it was sad how slow that was on LLMs.     NVidia really is the best with ROCm a very distant second and Intel pretty much not even on the map.    As for what model i would keep in my dooms day... right now GLM 4.5 hands down is the best&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
