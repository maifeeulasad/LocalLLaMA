My question is: do you see any problem in doing this? \nI’m not scared with messing with linux and i will install it, is ubuntu fine?\nIs it possible to have the proper driver installed on both the 6800xt and the mi50?\nOnce (and if) everything is recognized correctly will I be able to run both graphics cards with vulkan? And with rocm? I thougth about using llama.cpp, do you avdise something else?\n\nI dont want to maximize performance, but it would be very nice to be able to run a ~30B q4 with very large context.\n\nAnother point is that i will run very close to my psu limit, 850w, but i think i can confortably power limit both gpus when doing AI and disconnect the mi50 when gaming\n\nThank you!!\n",
