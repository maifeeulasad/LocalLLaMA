Seems logical right? Wrong. Most of our customers aren't starting from zero. They're looking for stuff like \"how to integrate with my existing Next.js\" or \"does this work with my current OpenAI setup?\" So I wrote a quickstart to help users go directly to the page they want before they start coding.\n\n**Make it systematic and scalable:** I checked our previous integration pages. We have Python/JS guides in one dropdown, OpenAI/Anthropic in another, features in a third, all at the same level. This approach created massive repetition across pages and became impossible to maintain. It was like writing hardcoded functions instead of reusable components. When someone needed \"feature X with Python and OpenAI\" they'd find examples everywhere and struggle to redirect to the actual page they expected.\n\n**Have an intention for how users should use them:** I always think you shouldn't just list all features and options without a preference. You need to first have a clear mind about what you want them to see. Every page is a feature, every link is user flow, and every search result is a conversion opportunity. You can't predict how users will navigate your docs so you need to build multiple pathways to the same information.\n\nFinally I pushed this 90% done documentation to production. There's still a long way to go but you can't ship products when you're 100% ready.\n\nI know there's still a lot of problems for this doc. I'm building an AI observability tool, please share your thoughts on how I could improve this if you're interested.
