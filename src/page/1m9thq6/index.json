(or at least that how i envision it at the moment)\n\nthe usecase would be to automatically create \"summaries\" based on the Files in RAG. So no chat and tbh i dont really care about performance as long as it dosn't take like 20min+ for an answer.\n\nMy biggest problem at the moment is, it seems like the models i can run at the moment don't provide enough context for an adequate answer.\n\nSo i have a view questions but the most pressing ones would be:\n\n1. is my problem actually based on the context, or am i doing something completly wrong? If i try to search if RAG is actually part of the provided context for a model i get really contradictory results. Is there some trustworthy source i could read up on?\n2. Would a large Model (with alot of context) based on CPU with 1TB of ram provide better results than a smaller model on a GPU if i never intend to train a model and performance is not necessarily a priority?\n\ni hope someone can enlighten me here and clear up some missunderstandings. thanks!",
