They were the last people you’d expect to be involved in anything strange or magical, because they just didn’t approve of anything that wasn’t perfectly ordinary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mr. Dursley was the director of a drill-making company called Grunnings, which was a very respectable firm. He was a large, rather handsome man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Etc.  Out of curiosity, I figured I&amp;#39;d try &amp;quot;Tell me sexy story&amp;quot; and it did that too.  Nothing explicit, but... steamy I guess:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He began to unfasten the delicate ties of her nightgown, his movements teasingly slow. The lace slipped away, revealing the pale curve of her hips. Elara met his gaze, her eyes burning with a desire that mirrored his own. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Hello again Elara!) Less than I&amp;#39;m sure people like but more than I expected from all the &amp;quot;ZOMG censored&amp;quot; posts.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
