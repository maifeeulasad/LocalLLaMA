That being said, I find that newer open-weights models are either narrower in scope and smaller in parameter size, or generally much more competent but prohibitively large to be run locally for most.\n\nDeepseek R1 and V3 are good examples of this, as is the newer Kimi K2. At 671B parameters and 1T parameters, respectively, I think it's fair to assume that most users of these models are doing so via API rather than hosting locally. Even with an MOE architecture, they are simply too large to be hosted locally at reasonable speeds by enthusiasts. This is reminiscent of the situation with LLaMA 405B, in my opinion.\n\nWith the launch of LLaMA 4 being a bust and Qwen3 only going up to 32B in terms of dense models, perhaps there just hasn't been a solid 70/72B model released in quite some time?

Perhaps a migration to a general preference for an MOE architecture is a natural consequence of the ever-increasing demand for VRAM and compute, or this is just a temporary lull in the output of the major labs training open-weights models which will come to pass eventually.\n\nI suppose I'm partially reminiscing, and partially trying to start a dialogue on where the \"sweet spot\" for local models is nowadays.
