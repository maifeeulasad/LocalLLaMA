I’ve gotten what looks like Twitter comments, the same thing I sent it, error codes, random stuff that makes no sense (but at least some what mirrors the style I specified).\n\nThis is usually a sign you have misconfigured the model in some way. You haven 't specified what program you are using, what model and what samplers etc. All of which are vital. Because when you use an open LLM you need to ensure you are using the right prompt template and settings suited to the model. Many programs limit the context size to a low number by default, meaning you need to adjust it manually to take full advantage of the model.\n\n&gt;CGPT says you can’t put much info in the world building or author notes because of tokens. It says local LLMs are more like continuing text you put in and don’t have the same training depth. Is that true?\n\nNo, it's mixing up a few different concepts and outdated info. There are open source base models which are pure completion models, meaning they aren't trained for instruct prompts, which are designed more for training and the like. But most popular open LLMs are instruct tuned.\n\nIt's also true that in the early days open models were quite context constrained, IE the 2K context windows of LLaMA and the 4K context window of Llama 2. But these days popular open models usually have 32K context at minimum, and often 128-256K. Some go up to 1M but they are rarer.\n\nThe context window is what determines how much text the LLM can  process at once. Getting into a full explanation of tokens is beyond this post, but there are plenty of good articles about it you can find with a bit of searching.\n\n&gt;Should I just train a model on my own voice? How many samples of my writing do I realistically need for that?

You haven &amp;#39;t specified what program you are using, what model and what samplers etc. All of which are vital. Because when you use an open LLM you need to ensure you are using the right prompt template and settings suited to the model. Many programs limit the context size to a low number by default, meaning you need to adjust it manually to take full advantage of the model.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;CGPT says you can’t put much info in the world building or author notes because of tokens. It says local LLMs are more like continuing text you put in and don’t have the same training depth. Is that true?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No, it&amp;#39;s mixing up a few different concepts and outdated info.
