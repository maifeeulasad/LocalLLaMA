That got me interested in learning how to run LLMs on my own machine, as well as exploring related areas like fine-tuning, distillation, quantization, etc.\n\nRight now, I'm using an RTX 2070 with 8GB VRAM, but I'm planning to build a new PC so I can run larger models. My target build is an RTX 5090 with 256GB RAM. I’m not in the US, so second-hand GPUs are harder to find, and I can only buy from BTO PC shops—so unfortunately, dual RTX 3090 setups aren’t an option. From what I understand, this setup should allow me to run Kimi-2 at 1.8-bit precision using CPU offloading, though only at around 3 tokens per second—which is slow, but good for experimentation (that is still 260k tokens per day if i run it non-stop).\n\nI’ve discussed the purchase with my wife, and she agreed—but only if I can create something genuinely useful with it.\n\nSo, I want to start a personal project in my free time. The idea is to build a chatbot that can tutor my child (currently in primary school, and eventually high school). The goal is to distill a larger model like Gemma 3 27B into a smaller version (ideally 3B or 7B) that I could run on my current machine.\n\nI'm aiming for a model (or models - may break down by subjects level or humanities/STEM field) that can:\n\n1. Generate practice questions for each primary school and secondary school subjects.\n2. Explain why an answer is right or wrong.\n3. Summarize or generate key facts for learning (across math, science, humanities, etc.).\n4. Grade and give feedback on writing/compositions.\n5. Able to do translate English to Simplified Chinese and vise versa (this can be on a different model)\n\nMy current skills:\n\n* Decent Python (I use it daily at work).\n* I’ve managed to get Gemma 3 4B Q4 running on Spyder (Python IDE) with GPU offloading. (This was hard and take me 1-2 days to configure my PC properly).\n\nRight now, using LLMs at home is purely for learning and experimentation. Hopefully, I can make something out of it in the future.\n\n# My main questions:\n\n1. Is a project like this realistic to complete in 3–6 months, assuming I keep learning and building during my free time? Or am I overpromising my wife and biting off more than I can chew? *Just to clarify, I don’t need this to be consumer-level software with a fancy UI and guardrails—I just need it to be usable via a terminal where my kid can type in questions and get decent, helpful responses.*\n2. Can I realistically make this chatbot with a 3B or 7B model, or would that be too small for the use case? Do I need at least a 13B model to get high enough quality responses?\n3. Is it possible (and reasonable) to distill from Gemma 3 27B or a similar large model to achieve this goal? Would it be better to use LoRAs or fine-tuning? (I'm still learning the exact trade-offs between them.)\n\nAny thoughts, advice, or personal experiences would be really appreciated. I'm eager to learn and would love to hear from others who’ve tried similar projects!",

I started from here, and it's pretty easy to run and get a feel for it ( https://github.com/dnhkng/GLaDOS)\n\nTechnically it looks feasible. I'm not sure if it would work as intended.\n\nThe problem I see is that models hallucinate and are quite compliant, and children have lots of imagination. You can restrict the model to a tight loop of speeking a question, getting an answer, and giving an explaination and moving on to the next.\n\nI'd really just build something and try it if it's close what you need. 8GB GPU is on the tight side to run local LLMs but you can run the poof of concept there. I would use LM Studio to run the LLM itself, and python toa ccess with OpenAI API, it's how I'm doing my things.\n\nAnd if it's about getting a good PC for yourself, talk it with the wife, maybe your can just afford a better toy without needing to have it do something useful beyond being a good computer.",

I started from here, and it&amp;#39;s pretty easy to run and get a feel for it ( &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/dnhkng/GLaDOS\"&gt;https://github.com/dnhkng/GLaDOS&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Technically it looks feasible. I&amp;#39;m not sure if it would work as intended.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem I see is that models hallucinate and are quite compliant, and children have lots of imagination. You can restrict the model to a tight loop of speeking a question, getting an answer, and giving an explaination and moving on to the next.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d really just build something and try it if it&amp;#39;s close what you need. 8GB GPU is on the tight side to run local LLMs but you can run the poof of concept there. I would use LM Studio to run the LLM itself, and python toa ccess with OpenAI API, it&amp;#39;s how I&amp;#39;m doing my things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if it&amp;#39;s about getting a good PC for yourself, talk it with the wife, maybe your can just afford a better toy without needing to have it do something useful beyond being a good computer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
