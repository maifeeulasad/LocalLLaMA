The whole gimmick is that you can tell the AI to be, for example, \"an aggressive player,\" and it's supposed to choose its moves and talk smack accordingly. It's been very fun to build.\n\nIt all worked great in testing, but I've hit a really annoying wall now that it's \"live\". I'm using Stockfish to find the top 5 best moves, then I send that list to the free Google Gemini API to have it pick a move that fits the personality. The problem is, if you play more than a couple of moves in a minute, the entire thing breaks. I'm getting hit with Error 429: Too Many Requests, which forces the AI to just give up on the personality and play the default move. It kind of ruins the whole point of the project.\n\nSo,  I'm looking for a free API alternative that's a option better for a hobby project like this. The main things I need are more rate limits that won't choke after a few turns, and a model that's smart enough to actually follow my role playing prompt. I've heard people mention services like OpenRouter or maybe something from Mistral, but I'm not sure what's realistic for a simple project without a budget.\n\nHas anyone else run into this and found a good solution? Any advice or pointers would be a huge help. Thanks",
