However, most new models tend to underwhelm me in actual usage. People have spoken of benchmaxxing a lot, and I'm really feeling it from many newer models. World knowledge in particular seems to have stagnated, and most models claiming more world knowledge in a smaller size than some competitor don't really live up to their claims.\n\nI've been experimenting with DeepSeek v3-0324, Kimi K2, Qwen 3 235B-A22B (original), Qwen 3 235B-A22B (2507 non-thinking), Llama 4 Maverick, Llama 3.3 70B, Mistral Large 2411, Cohere Command-A 2503, as well as smaller models like Qwen 3 30B-A3B, Mistral Small 3.2, and Gemma 3 27B. I've also been comparing to mid-size proprietary models like GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Claude 4 Sonnet.\n\nIn my experiments asking a broad variety of fresh world knowledge questions I made for a new private eval, they ranked as follows for world knowledge:\n\n1. DeekSeek v3 (0324)\n2. Mistral Large (2411)\n3. Kimi K2\n4. Cohere Command-A (2503)\n5. Qwen 3 235B-A22B (2507, non-thinking)\n6. Llama 4 Maverick\n7. Llama 3.3 70B\n8. Qwen 3 235B-A22B (original hybrid thinking model, with thinking turned off)\n9. Dots.LLM1\n10. Gemma 3 27B\n11. Mistral Small 3.2\n12. Qwen 3 30B-A3B\n\nIn my experiments, the only open model with knowledge comparable to Gemini 2.5 Flash and GPT 4.1 was DeepSeek v3.\n\nOf the open models I tried, the second best for world knowledge was Mistral Large 2411. Kimi K2 was in third place in my tests of world knowledge, not far behind Mistral Large in knowledge, but with more hallucinations, and a more strange, disorganized, and ugly response format.\n\nFourth place was Cohere Command A 2503, and fifth place was Qwen 3 2507. Llama 4 was a substantial step down, and only marginally better than Llama 3.3 70B in knowledge or intelligence. Qwen 3 235B-A22B had really poor knowledge for its size, and Dots.LLM1 was disappointing, hardly any more knowledgeable than Gemma 3 27B and no smarter either. Mistral Small 3.2 gave me good vibes, not too far behind Gemma 3 27B in knowledge, and decent intelligence. Qwen 3 30B-A3B also felt impressive to me; while the worst of the lot in world knowledge, it was very fast and still OK, honestly not that far off in knowledge from the original 235B that's nearly 8x bigger.\n\nAnyway, my point is that knowledge benchmarks like SimpleQA, GPQA, and PopQA need to be taken with a grain of salt. In terms of knowledge density, if you ignore benchmarks and try for yourself, you'll find that the latest and greatest like Qwen 3 235B-A22B-2507 and Kimi K2 are no better than Mistral Large 2407 from one year ago, and a step behind mid-size closed models like Gemini 2.5 Flash. It feels like we're hitting a wall with how much we can compress knowledge, and that improving programming and STEM problem solving capabilities comes at the expense of knowledge unless you increase parameter counts.\n\nThe other thing I noticed is that for Qwen specifically, the giant 235B-A22B models aren't that much more knowledgeable than the small 30B-A3B model. In my own test questions, Gemini 2.5 Flash would get around 90% right, DeepSeek v3 around 85% right, Kimi and Mistral Large around 75% right, Qwen 3 2507 around 70% right, Qwen 3 235B-A22B (original) around 60%, and Qwen 3 30B-A3B around 45%. The step up in knowledge from Qwen 3 30B to the original 235B was very underwhelming for the 8x size increase.",

It's not relevant to coding  but world knowledge is vital for STEM research.  I use this all the time.  You cannot replace this with internet search, because you're looking for novel links and ideas, not established facts.\n\nAnd the OP is entirely correct IME.  Other than DeepSeek (which is surprisingly good), open weights models are highly specialised and lack significant world knowledge.  The Qwen models in particular have almost zero STEM world knowledge.  (And that's fine, btw -- they've focused on a few niches, and that's a perfectly justifiable approach.)\n\n&gt;and largely the industry appears to agree with me.\n\nI don't think that's the case at all.  The flagship closed models all have astonishing world knowledge.  Training these models is immensely expensive, and if world knowledge wasn't deemed a highly desirable feature, they wouldn't waste resources training models with it.",

It&amp;#39;s not relevant to coding  but world knowledge is vital for STEM research.  I use this all the time.

Other than DeepSeek (which is surprisingly good), open weights models are highly specialised and lack significant world knowledge.  The Qwen models in particular have almost zero STEM world knowledge.

Trying to remember everything in the training data verbatim is not important to me.\n\n\\&gt; There's so much more to LLMs than coding.\n\nThis is very true - but the main thing I personally care about them doing especially well, is coding.
