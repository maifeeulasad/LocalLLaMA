Each patient would get 16x more radiation exposure just to see what should have been visible the first time.\n\nOn that day in the hospital basement, I decided somehow to fix this problem that's now generating $2k in monthly revenue. But it is now helping radiologists make accurate diagnoses from images that would have been unusable before.\n\nThe Problem I Was Really Solving\n\nAs a software developer with a background in medical imaging, I spent time observing radiologists struggle with degraded X-ray images, trying to identify barely visible pathologies. The physics are unforgiving: high-res X-rays require high radiation doses, but low-dose X-rays lose critical diagnostic detail.\n\nWhen my friend completed research on X-ray super resolution using [GANs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVWn8JfeekY), I saw an opportunity to turn this research paper into a practical solution.\n\nThe existing solutions were either too expensive (upgrading every imaging system costs millions) or too generic (standard upscaling algorithms that introduce more blur than clarity). Radiologists were stuck choosing between patient safety and diagnostic accuracy.\n\nThe breaking point wasn't just seeing patients get double dosed - it was realizing there was proven research showing a path forward, but no one had built it into a practical tool that radiologists could actually use.\n\nThe Technical Breakthrough\n\nI built what became XRayEnhance using Rocket to prototype the web interface around the proven XPGAN (X-ray Patch Generative Adversarial Network) algorithm. The research had already validated the approach - my job was making it accessible to radiologists.\n\nThe Core Technology (from the research):\n\nPatch-based processing that preserves fine-grained structural details\n\nGenerative adversarial network trained on 3,000 clinical X-ray images\n\nMoving average filters with random kernel sizes (1-40 pixels) for robustness\n\nFour-loss optimization: adversarial, pixel-wise, perceptual, and edge-preservation losses\n\nWhat I Built Around It:\n\nSimple drag-and-drop web interface for uploading X-ray DICOM files\n\nCloud processing pipeline using AWS GPU instances\n\nHIPAA-compliant storage and transmission\n\nIntegration with existing PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication Systems)\n\nThe first working prototype took 6 weeks to build, focusing on turning the research algorithm into a user-friendly web application.\n\nThe Growth Numbers (Early Traction)\n\nIn first 2 months I was Testing with 2 radiologist contacts from my network In next month I was able to get $290 from 1 small imaging center pilot By month 4: $580 from 2 centers, word spreading through referrals Month 5: $870 MRR (added batch processing feature) Month 6: $1,450 MRR (first hospital department trial)\n\nCurrent Unit Economics:\n\nMRR: $1,450\n\nCloud compute costs: $520/month (AWS GPU instances)\n\nInfrastructure &amp; compliance: $180/month\n\nGross profit: $750/month (52% margin)\n\nAverage customer acquisition cost: $95 (mostly referrals and medical imaging forums).\n\nWhat I actually understood is\n\nBuilding on proven research beats starting from scratch. Having validated algorithms meant I could focus on user experience and deployment rather than wondering if the core technology would work.\n\nMedical software is about trust and usability. Radiologists don't want to learn complex interfaces - they want their existing workflow enhanced with minimal friction.\n\nEarly traction comes from solving real pain points. The research proved the technical feasibility, but seeing radiologists immediately adopt the tool validated the market need.\n\nHospital procurement cycles are long but predictable. Once a radiology department validates the technology, the purchasing decision takes 4-6 months but rarely gets reversed.\n\nTechnical Reality\n\nUnlike consumer image enhancement that optimizes for visual appeal, medical super-resolution must preserve diagnostic accuracy. Our GAN architecture specifically avoids introducing artifacts that could be mistaken for pathologies.\n\nThe discriminator network acts like a junior radiologist, learning to distinguish between real high-resolution X-rays and our generated ones. This adversarial training forces the generator to produce medically accurate enhancements rather than just visually pleasing ones.\n\nWe validate every enhancement using automated metrics (SSIM, Laplacian variance) and radiologist review sessions where physicians compare diagnoses from original vs. enhanced images.\n\nThe Real Lesson\n\nThis business exists because I saw proven research that solved a real clinical problem and decided to turn it into a practical tool that radiologists could actually use.\n\nThe opportunity wasn't in inventing new AI algorithms - it was in understanding that brilliant academic research often stays hidden in those papers when it could be helping people solve real problems.",
