The queries are embedded again with nomic-embed-code and resulting vectors are used to search in the vector DB\n2. The keywords are used to do simple text search over codebase\n3. Each resulting (found) code chunk is then presented to the LLM (Mistral Small again now with structured output of {\"isRelevant\": boolean}) with context - user's original query, general project and micro-services description - and question \"here's the context, here's the code chunk that may be relevant to user's query. is it actual relevant?\" (I know reranking, but reranking is different, and I don't think it's what is needed)\n4. All the code chunks that were identified as {\"isRelevant\": true} - are then used for performing the actual task.\n\nI wrapped this in an MCP, so now I just work from within LM Studio or Roocode that calls the tool to get relevant code-chunks.\n\nI ran into small problem though - the whole search process with verification by LLM takes 5-10 minutes sometimes (when the query is vague and there are too many irrelevant chunks found), and MCP implementation that I use does not allow to set all timeouts easily, so I had to do code-search asynchronous - LLM calls search tool, then must call another tool to get results a bit later.\n\nThis whole exercise made me think that we need to approach coding with AI differently - today we have huge codebases, we structure classes and use some service architectures - microservices, SOLID, Hexagonal and whatnot. And that doesn't play so well with LLM, it's so hard to collect all bits of information together so that AI has all context.
