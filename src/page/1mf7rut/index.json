If we are paying 500/mo for example, why wouldnt we take that same 500/mo and finance our own hardware? Anything that you pay monthly for to a third party would obviously be cheaper to buy yourself since they obviously have to make money on top of paying for their hardware. A comparison would be using your own 10tb drive for storage vs paying monthly for 10tb of cloud storage. At like 9 months, it wouldve already been cheaper to just buy it outright. This is true for all use cases where you plan to indefinitely use teh thing (unlike renting one-off items like a moving truck). With that said, whatever you are paying Claude / Cursor for, should therotically be cheaper if you buy it outright at X timefrime (my guess is that it starts paying for itself at less than a year). For those that will then say \"well, they ar losing money right now\", ok that still means they will eventually have to hike prices, so there is no escaping this prediction that it will be smarter to buy than to rent if you are using this for fulltime work. So with that in mind, would a 20k machine at least match sonnet 4? A 40k machine? a 100k machine?",

The return on that would only possibly work if you have enough daily usage, and enough instances of Deepseek running to actually make back your investment. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is a cheaper card that works similarly, the RTX 6000 Pro 96GB at about $8,000 a piece, it is technically not unfeasible to get eight of them for under $70k, but would that really provide you a good ROI?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;LLMs scale relatively well to multiple users thanks to a feature called batch inferencing, available in VLLM. Hence, you could probably use a single machine to serve everyone in your organization pretty well. That said, the ability to run a model with coding capabilities similar to sonnets is incredibly difficult.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are only two open models that would really rival sonnet right now, Deepseek V3/R1 671B, and Qwen 3 Coder 480B. Unfortunately, these are both incredibly difficult to run, your best bet would be something like a 12-16 channel RAM server + 3090/RTX 6000 Pro 96GB. Even then, they would be slow, and you would likely end up having to run them in lower precision, but coding is a very precision sensitive use case.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically, if privacy is not Paramount, you will probably get a far better ROI just using an API/Cursor/Claude Code subscription. It&amp;#39;s just too difficult to get the hardware to run big models at this point in time&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
