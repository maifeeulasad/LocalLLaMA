After a few revisions (extending and including Jax sharded parallelism), I will transform it into a book. The article starts off with the interesting reference to Dr Mihai Nica’s interesting “A random variable is not random, and it’s not a variable\", kicking off the article’s explorations of human language transformation to machine readable computationally crunchable tokens and embeddings, using rich animations to then redirect us to building Llama2 from the core, basing it as the ‘equilibrium in the model space map’, a phrase meaning a solid understanding of Llama2 architecture could easily be mapped to any SOTA LLM variant with few iterations. I spin a fast inference as I document Modal’s awesome magic gpu pipelining without ssh. I then show the major transformations from Llama2 to ViT, coauthored by the infamous Lucas Beyer &amp; co. I then narrow to the four variants of ViTs benchmarked by DeepMind where I explore the architectures by further referencing the paper “Scaling ViTs”. The final section then explores parallelism, starting from Open-MPI in C, building programs in peer-to-peer and collective communications before then finally building data parallelism in DDP and exploring helix editor, tmux, ssh tunneling on RunPod to run distributed training. I then ultimately explore Fully Sharded Data Parallel and the transformations to the training pipeline!\n\nThe Article:https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CPwbWaJ\\_NiBZJ6NbHDlPBFYe9hf36Y0q/view?usp=sharing\n\nI built this article, standing on the shoulders of giants, people who never stopped building and enjoying open-source, and I appreciate the much you share on X, r/LocalLLaMA, and GPU MODE, led by Mark Saroufim &amp; co on YouTube! Your expertise has motivated me to learn a whole lot more by being curious!\n\nIf you feel I can thrive well in your collaborative team, working towards impactful research, I am currently open to work starting this Fall, open to relocation, open to internships with return offers available.
