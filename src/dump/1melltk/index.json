For the RAG system, I'm currently using RAGFlow, an open-source engine that I'm hosting in a Docker container.\n\nThis is running on a Google Cloud Platform VM instance with 2 vCPUs, 16GB of RAM, and a 200GB persistent disk. The server is working perfectly for my needs and I did not have any problems with hundreds of users per day. However, my GCP free trial is ending soon, and the regular price of €90/month is way too expensive for me to afford as a student.\n\nI'm now looking for a cheaper VPS provider. I've found a couple of options:\n\nHostinger: KVM VPS with 16GB RAM for ~€20/month.\n\ninformaten.com: KVM VPS with 16GB RAM for ~€12/month.\n\nI think I need a good amount of RAM because RAGFlow's vectorDB seems to need it to work properly.\n\nHere are my questions for the community:\n\nIs a KVM VPS suitable for my needs? Given that I'm hosting a RAG engine with a vector database, is a KVM VPS powerful enough, or do I need to look at a dedicated server?\n\nWhat about the control panel? GCP has a very intuitive control panel with a lot of features. Will providers like Hostinger and informaten.com offer a similar level of control? If it is close enough to GCP then I am good with it.\n\nWhat else should I consider? As someone new to server hosting, are there other important factors I should be taking into account when choosing a provider?\n\nDo I need a special server to host Docker? Or will any standard KVM VPS work for this?\n\nMy only real requirement is to be able to host RAGFlow in a Docker container and access the RAGFlow API through a public IP address.\n\nThank you in advance for your help and your answers",
