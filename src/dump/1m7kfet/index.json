            "body": "RAG uses a search engine or database (which are different things, but can have extensive overlap).  It is searching for content relevant to a prompt, with which to ground LLM inference in truth (ideally) or at least help it infer more competently.\n\nRAG with ElasticSearch is still RAG.  RAG doesn't have to use a vector database, though that's currently the popular practice.\n\nI have been using Lucy (a pure-C implementation \"inspired by\" Lucene) to implement RAG for years now, and it does a pretty good job.  I've been meaning to switch to hybrid search (Lucy + vector DB, not sure which vector DB yet) because stemming isn't always sufficient to find relevant content.\n\nIf your data is sufficiently well-organized, you could even use a relational database.  Some relational databases have vector extensions, too (like Postgres' `pgvector` extension), so these aren't mutually exclusive.\n\nThe underlying mechanism matters less than the general principle:  RAG looks up stored data with which to populate context for augmented inference.  Changing the technology you use to look things up doesn't make it not-RAG.\n\nYour questions about chunking and dependencies/references across chunks are quite apt.

RAG doesn&amp;#39;t have to use a vector database, though that&amp;#39;s currently the popular practice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have been using Lucy (a pure-C implementation &amp;quot;inspired by&amp;quot; Lucene) to implement RAG for years now, and it does a pretty good job.  I&amp;#39;ve been meaning to switch to hybrid search (Lucy + vector DB, not sure which vector DB yet) because stemming isn&amp;#39;t always sufficient to find relevant content.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If your data is sufficiently well-organized, you could even use a relational database.
