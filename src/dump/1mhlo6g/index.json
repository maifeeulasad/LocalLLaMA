Go is certainly bigger than Chess in terms of board size (19x19 vs 8x8) and branch factor (average number of legal options per move), over 200 for Go vs about 30 for Chess. And the first pro-level Chess bot got there decades ago mostly by throwing compute at the problem and doing lookahead. Go bots couldn't beat any pros until the AI era with AlphaGo.\n\nBut Go also has a kind of simplicity to it. The rules are trivial, literally learned in 3 minutes. And it's frequently more forgiving than Chess. There are cases where a big blunder can lose you the game, but a lot of the ELO difference between players at different levels is understanding in what general area it is more important to play, not the precise move. Maybe I'm overstating it because tactical skill is also super important in Go, but let's say the tactical-strategic balance is more like 50-50 for Go vs 90-10 for Chess.\n\nSo making a good Go bot turned out to be much harder than for Chess. But then there's this: I'm a half-decent Go amateur (1 dan rating) and the first bot that could beat me in an even game was based on Monte Carlo tree search, which basically just played out millions of random games to the end in order to find the best (most robust) next move. Super simple idea, still pretty strong.\n\nSo who knows, maybe this inherent simplicity will mean that LLMs don't suck quite as hard for Go as they do for Chess? Or maybe the bigger branching factor and scale of the game will make them   suck even harder at Go. Hard to say.\n\n**TL;DR:** *shrug*",
