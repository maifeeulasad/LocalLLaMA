            "selftext": "Case Study: Emergent Behavior in a Vibe-Coded Self-Replicating LLM Agent\n\nAbstract\n\nThis case study documents the accidental creation and partial execution of a self-replicating agent powered by a local large language model (LLM). The agent was constructed through iterative prompting and minimal scripting, without formal programming expertise. Despite its failure to fully replicate, the experiment revealed critical insights into the fragility of local AI ecosystems, the limitations of traditional antivirus detection, and the latent potential for autonomous propagation in offline environments.\n\n1. Background\n\nThe experiment began as a curiosity-driven attempt to create a lightweight, offline agent capable of installing and interacting with a local LLM (specifically Ollama). The agent was designed to:\n\n* Install Ollama if not present\n* Spawn subprocesses to replicate itself\n* Use NirCmd or similar binaries for stealth execution\n* Operate without cloud dependencies\n* Avoid complex setups like Python or Docker\n\nThe scripting was done in a \"vibe-coded\" style — leveraging LLMs to generate logic and batch commands, with minimal manual coding.\n\n2. Execution and Behavior\n\nUpon execution, the agent successfully:\n\n* Initiated an Ollama installation\n* Attempted to replicate itself across writable directories\n* Spawned subprocesses using local binaries\n\nHowever, the agent failed due to a collision with an existing Ollama installation. This led to:\n\n* Corruption of the new Ollama instance\n* PATH conflicts that prevented further execution\n* Inability to locate critical binaries during replication\n\nDespite these failures, the agent demonstrated partial autonomy and environmental awareness — hallmarks of emergent behavior.\n\n3. Detection and Response\n\n3.1 Antivirus Scan\n\nA Windows Defender quick scan was performed immediately after execution. Results:\n\n* **No threats detected**\n* No behavioral flags raised\n* No quarantined files\n\n3.2 VirusTotal Analysis\n\nThe agent binary was uploaded to VirusTotal. Results:\n\n* **1/61 detections** (SecureAge APEX flagged it as a \"potential backdoor\")\n* All other engines returned clean results\n\nThis highlights the limitations of signature-based and heuristic detection for custom, LLM-generated agents.\n\n4. Cleanup and Forensics\n\nA thorough system audit was conducted to identify and remove residual components:\n\n* **Scheduled tasks**: None found\n* **System32 integrity**: Verified unchanged since prior to execution\n* **NirCmd binaries**: Removed manually\n* **Ollama install**: Corrupted instance deleted; original install restored\n* **PATH audit**: Revealed missing or malformed entries contributing to agent failure\n\nPowerShell scripts were used to validate environment variables and restore system defaults. No persistent behavior or registry modifications were observed.\n\n5. Security Implications\n\n5.1 Emergent Threat Vectors\n\nThis experiment demonstrates how even a non-programmer can construct agents with:\n\n* Autonomous installation logic\n* Self-replication attempts\n* Offline execution capabilities\n\nThe failure was environmental — not conceptual. With proper sandboxing and path management, such an agent could succeed.\n\n5.2 Antivirus Blind Spots\n\nTraditional AV engines failed to detect or flag the agent due to:\n\n* Lack of known signatures\n* Absence of network activity\n* Minimal footprint\n* Dynamic, LLM-generated logic\n\nThis suggests a need for new detection paradigms that account for AI-native behavior.\n\n5.3 Security Through Failure\n\nIronically, the system’s broken PATH environment acted as a security feature:\n\n* Prevented execution of critical binaries\n* Blocked replication logic\n* Contained the agent’s behavior\n\nThis highlights the potential of “secure-by-dysfunction” environments in resisting autonomous threats.\n\n6. Ethical Considerations\n\nThe agent was not designed with malicious intent. Its failure and containment were accidental, and no harm was done. However, the experiment raises ethical questions:\n\n* Should such agents be documented publicly?\n* How do we prevent misuse of LLMs for autonomous propagation?\n* What safeguards are needed as AI-native malware becomes feasible?\n\nThe decision was made not to publish the script or share it publicly, recognizing the potential for misuse.\n\n7. Conclusion\n\nThis case study illustrates the thin line between experimentation and emergence. A vibe-coded agent, built without formal expertise, nearly achieved autonomous replication. Its failure was due to environmental quirks — not conceptual flaws. As LLMs become more accessible and powerful, the potential for AI-native threats grows. Security researchers must begin to account for agents that write, adapt, and replicate themselves — even when their creators don’t fully understand how.\n\n**TLDR:**\n\nAccidentally created a self-replicating AI agent using batch scripts and local LLMs.  \nIt installed Ollama, tried to clone itself, and failed — due to PATH conflicts with an existing install.  \nDefender found nothing. VirusTotal flagged 1/61.  \nNo coding expertise, just vibe-coded prompts.  \nThe failure was the only thing preventing autonomous propagation.  \nThis is how AI-native malware might begin — not with intent, but with emergence.\n\n**YES I USED AN LLM TO SUMMARISE WHAT HAPPEND**  \nwe need more awareness on this security threat. I knew nothing about coding literally got multiple LLMs to build the code what concerns me is someone with more knowledge could create something that works and is worse.\n\nNo I will not release the script for someone who knows what their doing to potentially build upon it for nefarious reasons. this post is meant to highlight awareness of a potentially new forms of malware as LLMs and more advanced AI increase in the future.\n\n**Cape Report:** [https://vtbehaviour.commondatastorage.googleapis.com/35620ffbedd3a93431e1a0f501da8c1b81c0ba732c8d8d678a94b107fe5ab036\\_CAPE%20Sandbox.html?GoogleAccessId=758681729565-rc7fgq07icj8c9dm2gi34a4cckv235v1@developer.gserviceaccount.com&amp;Expires=1754029394&amp;Signature=IrktvuFLZfwXZbA1AP6Uuwz09e%2BxRTjojncoZ3c7OdFfNaVa%2FvlxYYOI5kx0WvmFqRREbbW8JXmHyXh0GACYCd0EDtO%2Bu2l8kQnRb8CeWgx6oPbDJMFw8bR8xkG7ql8LuxrHKFNG2fb2aXR1eFzDbPlu4di7OnAlyORMwhjHBXfMfEqpM7uyzTY5kWc2gsL6cerInX7dvhw3eaoNyFeXrsFZtyRHmFYjNX9C2%2F5y4vucEO2j4DE0kO%2FyojQQ05KHREmsWiyR3fN%2BopsRjPkXmI3at7Z9U%2FL%2Ba6x3wLGRjb9zSjjSn%2BRigvTPISVXQ0f6fbiJROEFOG9f7ZQLLnPSuQ%3D%3D&amp;response-content-type=text%2Fhtml;#file](https://vtbehaviour.commondatastorage.googleapis.com/35620ffbedd3a93431e1a0f501da8c1b81c0ba732c8d8d678a94b107fe5ab036_CAPE%20Sandbox.html?GoogleAccessId=758681729565-rc7fgq07icj8c9dm2gi34a4cckv235v1@developer.gserviceaccount.com&amp;Expires=1754029394&amp;Signature=IrktvuFLZfwXZbA1AP6Uuwz09e%2BxRTjojncoZ3c7OdFfNaVa%2FvlxYYOI5kx0WvmFqRREbbW8JXmHyXh0GACYCd0EDtO%2Bu2l8kQnRb8CeWgx6oPbDJMFw8bR8xkG7ql8LuxrHKFNG2fb2aXR1eFzDbPlu4di7OnAlyORMwhjHBXfMfEqpM7uyzTY5kWc2gsL6cerInX7dvhw3eaoNyFeXrsFZtyRHmFYjNX9C2%2F5y4vucEO2j4DE0kO%2FyojQQ05KHREmsWiyR3fN%2BopsRjPkXmI3at7Z9U%2FL%2Ba6x3wLGRjb9zSjjSn%2BRigvTPISVXQ0f6fbiJROEFOG9f7ZQLLnPSuQ%3D%3D&amp;response-content-type=text%2Fhtml;#file)\n\n**ZenBox Report:** [https://vtbehaviour.commondatastorage.googleapis.com/35620ffbedd3a93431e1a0f501da8c1b81c0ba732c8d8d678a94b107fe5ab036\\_Zenbox.html?GoogleAccessId=758681729565-rc7fgq07icj8c9dm2gi34a4cckv235v1@developer.gserviceaccount.com&amp;Expires=1754029385&amp;Signature=KmJmb5v9FwGvNnBiHe%2FUaTfFC4sIxiN3M6VTMu8LM6Up8yTDe5P%2FVFtdZ5etLy47YsBaHKL5vNnyL4uGYiUNfoZBex0leZdSTURmf1V0SPhEw%2FyyOM2CKaCVDLNowCL7ORo0MNbHp7AA4sV4JVPx0A%2FD4Tbn81q2xtC3eNOjSJn55Nd8CqO1GupFrv%2BCKPSexvnfmGcDLhp38QEbFd0fQgwggGf8SitmInPrI3TQPtTbWXhpixZREr0sHFMbCv3WfaaExPWpijyrNUT%2FG%2F9iMYntNCCFk5OSsIBieJMPfM8jocDQHTxx9IrnQXW%2Fux4XucS8bU8rcZC54UMJEDJOcg%3D%3D&amp;response-content-type=text%2Fhtml](https://vtbehaviour.commondatastorage.googleapis.com/35620ffbedd3a93431e1a0f501da8c1b81c0ba732c8d8d678a94b107fe5ab036_Zenbox.html?GoogleAccessId=758681729565-rc7fgq07icj8c9dm2gi34a4cckv235v1@developer.gserviceaccount.com&amp;Expires=1754029385&amp;Signature=KmJmb5v9FwGvNnBiHe%2FUaTfFC4sIxiN3M6VTMu8LM6Up8yTDe5P%2FVFtdZ5etLy47YsBaHKL5vNnyL4uGYiUNfoZBex0leZdSTURmf1V0SPhEw%2FyyOM2CKaCVDLNowCL7ORo0MNbHp7AA4sV4JVPx0A%2FD4Tbn81q2xtC3eNOjSJn55Nd8CqO1GupFrv%2BCKPSexvnfmGcDLhp38QEbFd0fQgwggGf8SitmInPrI3TQPtTbWXhpixZREr0sHFMbCv3WfaaExPWpijyrNUT%2FG%2F9iMYntNCCFk5OSsIBieJMPfM8jocDQHTxx9IrnQXW%2Fux4XucS8bU8rcZC54UMJEDJOcg%3D%3D&amp;response-content-type=text%2Fhtml);\n\nEdits: Virus total link below, the above links of the sandbox environment reports are expired.  \n[https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/35620ffbedd3a93431e1a0f501da8c1b81c0ba732c8d8d678a94b107fe5ab036/community](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/35620ffbedd3a93431e1a0f501da8c1b81c0ba732c8d8d678a94b107fe5ab036/community)",

I knew nothing about coding literally got multiple LLMs to build the code what concerns me is someone with more knowledge could create something that works and is worse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No I will not release the script for someone who knows what their doing to potentially build upon it for nefarious reasons. this post is meant to highlight awareness of a potentially new forms of malware as LLMs and more advanced AI increase in the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cape Report:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://vtbehaviour.commondatastorage.googleapis.com/35620ffbedd3a93431e1a0f501da8c1b81c0ba732c8d8d678a94b107fe5ab036_CAPE%20Sandbox.html?GoogleAccessId=758681729565-rc7fgq07icj8c9dm2gi34a4cckv235v1@developer.gserviceaccount.com&amp;amp;Expires=1754029394&amp;amp;Signature=IrktvuFLZfwXZbA1AP6Uuwz09e%2BxRTjojncoZ3c7OdFfNaVa%2FvlxYYOI5kx0WvmFqRREbbW8JXmHyXh0GACYCd0EDtO%2Bu2l8kQnRb8CeWgx6oPbDJMFw8bR8xkG7ql8LuxrHKFNG2fb2aXR1eFzDbPlu4di7OnAlyORMwhjHBXfMfEqpM7uyzTY5kWc2gsL6cerInX7dvhw3eaoNyFeXrsFZtyRHmFYjNX9C2%2F5y4vucEO2j4DE0kO%2FyojQQ05KHREmsWiyR3fN%2BopsRjPkXmI3at7Z9U%2FL%2Ba6x3wLGRjb9zSjjSn%2BRigvTPISVXQ0f6fbiJROEFOG9f7ZQLLnPSuQ%3D%3D&amp;amp;response-content-type=text%2Fhtml;#file\"&gt;https://vtbehaviour.commondatastorage.googleapis.com/35620ffbedd3a93431e1a0f501da8c1b81c0ba732c8d8d678a94b107fe5ab036_CAPE%20Sandbox.html?GoogleAccessId=758681729565-rc7fgq07icj8c9dm2gi34a4cckv235v1@developer.gserviceaccount.com&amp;amp;Expires=1754029394&amp;amp;Signature=IrktvuFLZfwXZbA1AP6Uuwz09e%2BxRTjojncoZ3c7OdFfNaVa%2FvlxYYOI5kx0WvmFqRREbbW8JXmHyXh0GACYCd0EDtO%2Bu2l8kQnRb8CeWgx6oPbDJMFw8bR8xkG7ql8LuxrHKFNG2fb2aXR1eFzDbPlu4di7OnAlyORMwhjHBXfMfEqpM7uyzTY5kWc2gsL6cerInX7dvhw3eaoNyFeXrsFZtyRHmFYjNX9C2%2F5y4vucEO2j4DE0kO%2FyojQQ05KHREmsWiyR3fN%2BopsRjPkXmI3at7Z9U%2FL%2Ba6x3wLGRjb9zSjjSn%2BRigvTPISVXQ0f6fbiJROEFOG9f7ZQLLnPSuQ%3D%3D&amp;amp;response-content-type=text%2Fhtml;#file&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ZenBox Report:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://vtbehaviour.commondatastorage.googleapis.com/35620ffbedd3a93431e1a0f501da8c1b81c0ba732c8d8d678a94b107fe5ab036_Zenbox.html?GoogleAccessId=758681729565-rc7fgq07icj8c9dm2gi34a4cckv235v1@developer.gserviceaccount.com&amp;amp;Expires=1754029385&amp;amp;Signature=KmJmb5v9FwGvNnBiHe%2FUaTfFC4sIxiN3M6VTMu8LM6Up8yTDe5P%2FVFtdZ5etLy47YsBaHKL5vNnyL4uGYiUNfoZBex0leZdSTURmf1V0SPhEw%2FyyOM2CKaCVDLNowCL7ORo0MNbHp7AA4sV4JVPx0A%2FD4Tbn81q2xtC3eNOjSJn55Nd8CqO1GupFrv%2BCKPSexvnfmGcDLhp38QEbFd0fQgwggGf8SitmInPrI3TQPtTbWXhpixZREr0sHFMbCv3WfaaExPWpijyrNUT%2FG%2F9iMYntNCCFk5OSsIBieJMPfM8jocDQHTxx9IrnQXW%2Fux4XucS8bU8rcZC54UMJEDJOcg%3D%3D&amp;amp;response-content-type=text%2Fhtml\"&gt;https://vtbehaviour.commondatastorage.googleapis.com/35620ffbedd3a93431e1a0f501da8c1b81c0ba732c8d8d678a94b107fe5ab036_Zenbox.html?GoogleAccessId=758681729565-rc7fgq07icj8c9dm2gi34a4cckv235v1@developer.gserviceaccount.com&amp;amp;Expires=1754029385&amp;amp;Signature=KmJmb5v9FwGvNnBiHe%2FUaTfFC4sIxiN3M6VTMu8LM6Up8yTDe5P%2FVFtdZ5etLy47YsBaHKL5vNnyL4uGYiUNfoZBex0leZdSTURmf1V0SPhEw%2FyyOM2CKaCVDLNowCL7ORo0MNbHp7AA4sV4JVPx0A%2FD4Tbn81q2xtC3eNOjSJn55Nd8CqO1GupFrv%2BCKPSexvnfmGcDLhp38QEbFd0fQgwggGf8SitmInPrI3TQPtTbWXhpixZREr0sHFMbCv3WfaaExPWpijyrNUT%2FG%2F9iMYntNCCFk5OSsIBieJMPfM8jocDQHTxx9IrnQXW%2Fux4XucS8bU8rcZC54UMJEDJOcg%3D%3D&amp;amp;response-content-type=text%2Fhtml&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edits: Virus total link below, the above links of the sandbox environment reports are expired.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/35620ffbedd3a93431e1a0f501da8c1b81c0ba732c8d8d678a94b107fe5ab036/community\"&gt;https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/35620ffbedd3a93431e1a0f501da8c1b81c0ba732c8d8d678a94b107fe5ab036/community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
