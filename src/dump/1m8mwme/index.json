Tulu3-70B and Tulu3-405B have to infer on CPU, and even then Tulu3-405B needs its context limit reduced to 8K to fit in memory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All models are GGUF quantized to Q4_K_M.  I am using llama.cpp exclusively.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some performance figures for pure CPU inference:  &lt;a href=\"http://ciar.org/h/performance.html\"&gt;http://ciar.org/h/performance.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Copy-pasting from the last time someone asked &amp;quot;why local&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Privacy, both personal and professional (my employers are pro-AI, but don&amp;#39;t want people pasting proprietary company data into ChatGPT). Relatedly, see: &lt;a href=\"https://tumithak.substack.com/p/the-paper-and-the-panopticon\"&gt;https://tumithak.substack.com/p/the-paper-and-the-panopticon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;No guardrails (some local models need jailbreaking, but many do not),&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfettered competence -- similar to &amp;quot;no guardrails&amp;quot; -- OpenAI deliberately nerfs some model skills, such as persuasion, but a local model can be made as persuasive as the technology permits,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can choose different models specialized for different tasks/domains (eg medical inference), which can exceed commercial AI&amp;#39;s competence within that narrow domain,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;No price-per-token, just price of operation (which might be a net win, or not, depending on your use-case),&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reliability, if you can avoid borking your system as frequently as OpenAI borks theirs,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Works when disconnected -- you don&amp;#39;t need a network connection to use local inference,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Predictability -- your model only changes when you decide it changes, whereas OpenAI updates their model a few times a year,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future-proofing -- commercial services come and go, or change their prices, or may face legal/regulatory challenges, but a model on your own hardware is yours to use forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;More inference features/options -- open source inference stacks get some new features before commercial services do, and they can be more flexible and easier to use (for example, llama.cpp&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;grammars&amp;quot; had been around for about a year before OpenAI rolled out their equivalent &amp;quot;schemas&amp;quot; feature).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1lbbafh/why_local_llm/mxsio2i/\"&gt;https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1lbbafh/why_local_llm/mxsio2i/&lt;/a&gt; for more replies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
