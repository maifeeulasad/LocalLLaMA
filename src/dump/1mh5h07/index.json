This will be optimal for gaming (the Pro 6000 even beats the 5090 a little in gaming, IIRC) and will be quite solid for LLMs but you unfortunately won't be able to effectively run the very large LLMs like Deepseek very effectively.  That might not be a dealbreaker though as right now models are releasing (GLM-4.5-Air and maybe a 120B from OpenAI?) that would be quite effective on the Pro 6000.\n\nThe secondary option would be more for LLM than gaming: a 5090 with a Epyc CPU and 768GB of memory.  The lower clock speeds of the Epyc and the 5090 vs Pro 6000 will hurt gaming a bit.  However, the huge memory will allow you to run just about any model out there at acceptable speeds.  (Though the mid sized models that would fit on the Pro 6000 and not 5090 will perform much worse.)  You could swap a Threadripper PRO 9000 for the Epyc to get higher clock speeds again, but would be paying a lot more and giving up LLM performance (TR only has 8 channel of memory to Epyc's 12 so Epyc is 50% faster but TR can overclock memory to close the gap a little.)",

The CCDs have a bandwidth limited connection to the I/O chiplet of roughly 60GBps/link.  You can see that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/threadripper/comments/1azmkvg/comparing_threadripper_7000_memory_bandwidth_for/).  It doesn't matter how fast your memory if you don't have enough CCDs accessing it in parallel.\n\nNow, that's Zen4 Threadripper but Zen5 is mostly the same with some higher clocks.  The one wrinkle is that on Epyc processors with low CCD counts used 2 CCD-IO die links for 120GBps.  The above benchmarks indicate that Zen4 TR doesn't, but if Zen5 does you could max out your memory bandwidth with 4 CCDs.  Otherwise you need the 8/12 CCD models if you want to be able to use your 8ch memory.",

The CCDs have a bandwidth limited connection to the I/O chiplet of roughly 60GBps/link.  You can see that &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/threadripper/comments/1azmkvg/comparing_threadripper_7000_memory_bandwidth_for/\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  It doesn&amp;#39;t matter how fast your memory if you don&amp;#39;t have enough CCDs accessing it in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, that&amp;#39;s Zen4 Threadripper but Zen5 is mostly the same with some higher clocks.  The one wrinkle is that on Epyc processors with low CCD counts used 2 CCD-IO die links for 120GBps.  The above benchmarks indicate that Zen4 TR doesn&amp;#39;t, but if Zen5 does you could max out your memory bandwidth with 4 CCDs.  Otherwise you need the 8/12 CCD models if you want to be able to use your 8ch memory.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Spent overall 8k.\n\nKnowing what I know now, I'd be biased to go with Mac with the 512GB unified memory on the fact you can virtually run the best SOTA open-source in that range, however, at the sacrifice of much, much lower GPU speed, but you'd also win in less heating and energy expenditure. A lot less.\n\nI'd fork another 10k just to get the RTX Pro 6000 and still wouldn't be enough to run some higher parameter models with decent context window for what I work with - there's workarounds though.\n\nWith 10-13k in GPUs, you can spend a lot in tokens pulling models with OpenRouter, so that's the upfront you wouldn't need to spend, as we may not know if tomorrow's LLMs will get much more efficient. I see 30B models getting much smarter that can fit in RTX 5090 and you have a beast GPU for gaming.\n\nIf you're not heavy in LLM, or still discovering. My setup is more than enough.   \nFor gaming, I'd cut the the memory down to 32GB with faster memory, and get 9950X3D for the mega boost in gaming.   \n  \nDoesn't affect other works as apparently it's slightly better than 9950X, I just couldn't justify spending another 200 bux at the time for the marginal difference and gaming wasn't my priority, but since I work with a lot of software, RAM was needed.\n\nAlternatively, you could look into server gear like Threadripper and have a much higher ceiling for RAM and channels to process an LLM on memory quicker than a consumer rig. The caveat is, for 10k that's what you'd spend on basics for a server rig.

Spent overall 8k.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Knowing what I know now, I&amp;#39;d be biased to go with Mac with the 512GB unified memory on the fact you can virtually run the best SOTA open-source in that range, however, at the sacrifice of much, much lower GPU speed, but you&amp;#39;d also win in less heating and energy expenditure. A lot less.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d fork another 10k just to get the RTX Pro 6000 and still wouldn&amp;#39;t be enough to run some higher parameter models with decent context window for what I work with - there&amp;#39;s workarounds though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With 10-13k in GPUs, you can spend a lot in tokens pulling models with OpenRouter, so that&amp;#39;s the upfront you wouldn&amp;#39;t need to spend, as we may not know if tomorrow&amp;#39;s LLMs will get much more efficient.
