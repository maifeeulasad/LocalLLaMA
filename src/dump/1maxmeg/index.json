It’s to let regular people contribute, even in small ways, to meaningful projects. Kind of like BOINC or Folding@Home, but focused on AI with more transparency.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if the impact is limited, it could still help smaller teams who don’t have access to cloud resources, and maybe serve as a testing ground for lightweight collaborative training methods.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m convinced there are plenty of people with great ideas who could move things forward, but they simply don&amp;#39;t have the financial means to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
