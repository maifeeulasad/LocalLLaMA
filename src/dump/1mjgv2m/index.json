I have a very old PC that I have been using as a Plex server for some time. It has an Intel i7-8700 processor and an msi z370 motherboard. It currently has a 1060 in it but I was thinking about replacing it with 2x Tesla p40s. The PSU is 1000w so I THINK I am OK on power. My question is other than the issue where fp16 is a no go for LLMs, does anyone have any red flags that I am not aware of? Still relatively new to the AI game but I think having an extra 48gb of vram to run in parallel to my 5090 could add a lot more capability to any agents that I want to build ",
