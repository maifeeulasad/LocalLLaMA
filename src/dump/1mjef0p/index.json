            "body": "Quants are weird.  Honestly?  Maybe try both and see since ultimately it's difficult to predict how quality is affected.\n\nTechnically there isn't like a singular answer since any quant of any model is going to be a mix of types, both due to user designs and tensors layout (quants are done in blocks so if you have 20 parameters you can't use a 16 block size quant).  Here's a breakdown: \n\n| Tensor                       | IQ3_XXS  | Q2_K_XL |\n| ---------------------------- | -------- | ------- |\n| blk.5.attn_k.weight          | IQ4_XS   |  Q4_K   |\n| blk.5.attn_q.weight          | IQ4_XS   |  Q4_K   |\n| blk.5.attn_v.weight          | IQ4_XS   |  Q4_K   |\n| blk.5.ffn_down_exps.weight   | IQ3_S    |  Q3_K   |\n| blk.5.ffn_down_shexp.weight  | Q5_K     |  Q4_K   |\n| blk.5.ffn_gate_exps.weight   | IQ3_XXS  |  Q2_K   |\n| blk.5.ffn_gate_shexp.weight  | IQ4_XS   |  Q4_K   |\n| blk.5.ffn_up_exps.weight     | IQ3_XXS  |  Q2_K   |\n| blk.5.ffn_up_shexp.weight    | IQ4_XS   |  Q4_K   |\n| blk.5.attn_output.weight     | IQ4_XS   |  Q4_K   |\n\nNote that the Q2_K_XL is ironically mostly not Q2_K (just the experts which are the bulk of the model TBF).  This is because the `K_XL` is an unsloth custom, IIRC, that sets tensors like `attn_*` to Q4_K where as a standard `K_M`would use Q2_K.  This is a big difference in quality but also has a big affect on behavior.  The `attn_*` tenors are always active (unlike the experts) and make up like 1/4 of the model's active parameters, meaning doubling their size would increase memory bandwidth usage by 5/4 even though the size of disk barely changes (I explain/benchmark this a little better with GPT-OSS quants [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1miuluj/why_unsloth_gptoss_quatizations_reduces_so_little/n76abo1/)).  However, they are also what ends up on the GPU when you run `-ngl 99 -ot exps=CPU` so aren't going to be a major problem with mixed CPU+GPU inference.\n\nBeyond that, mostly what you may notice here is that they aren't _super_ different and the biggest difference is the IQ# vs Q#.  The IQ# are generally considered better than the equivalent Q4_K, but at the expense of requiring more compute.  So broadly I would say if you have surplus compute (vs memory bandwidth) the IQ3_XXS will be better but if you don't the Q2_K_XL might be better.  In terms of quality, I suspect IQ3_XXS is a little a bit better but I doubt you'll see any practical effect (but it's almost certainly better than a Q2_K since I think heavily quantized attn can hurt a lot).",
