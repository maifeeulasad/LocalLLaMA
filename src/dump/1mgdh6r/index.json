One is buy expensive 3090, or even more expensive 5000 series or, buy cheap and try it. This post will cover why the P102-100 is still relevant and why it is simply the best budget card to get at 60 dollars.\n\nIf you are just doing LLM, Vision and no image or video generation. This is hands down the best budget card to get all because of its memory bandwidth. This list covers entry level cards form all series. Yes I know there are better cards but I am comparing the P102-100 with all entry level cards only and those better cards are 10x more.This is for the budget build people.\n\n2060 - 336.0 GB/s - $150 8GB  \n3060 - 360.0 GB/s - $200+ 8GB\n\n4060 - 272.0 GB/s - $260+ 8GB\n\n5060 - 448.0 GB/s - $350+ 8GB\n\nP102-100 - 440.3 GB/s - $60 10GB.\n\nIs the P102-100 faster than an\n\nentry 2060 = yes\n\nentry 3060 = yes\n\nentry 4060 = yes.\n\nonly a 5060 would be faster and not by much.\n\nDoes the P102-100 load slower, yes it takes about 1 second per GB on the model. PCie 1x4 =1GB/s but once the model is leaded it will be normal with no delays on all your queries.\n\nI have attached screenshots of a bunch of models, all with 32K context so you can see what to expect. Compare those results with other entry cards using the same 32K context and you will for yourself. Make sure they are using 32K context as the P102-100 would also be faster with lower context.\n\nso if you want to try LLM's and not go broke, the P102-100 is a solid card to try for 60 bucks. I have 2 of them and those results are using 2 cards so I have 20GB VRAM for 70 bucks at 35 each when I bought them. Now they would be 120 bucks. I am not sure if you can get 20GB VRAM for less than is as fast as this.\n\nI hope this helps other people that have been afraid to try local private ai because of the costs. I hope this motivates you to at least try. It is just 60 bucks.\n\nI will probably be updating this next week as I have a third card and I am moving up to 30GB. I should be able to run these models with higher context, 128k, 256k and even bigger models. I will post some updates for anyone interested.",

But this is true only on empty context. For tasks where context caching is not helpful, such as rag or coding, prompt processing speed is very important. besides low-compute card will be much slower at 8-16k (IMO most useful range) of context than slightly lower bandwidth higher compute card.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
