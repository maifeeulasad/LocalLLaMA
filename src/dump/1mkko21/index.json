I'm a full stack developer and I've been doing this for quite some time. \n\nMy broad workflow is: start with a few paragraphs description of my idea, and ask the LLM to generate questions about ambiguities in this description and possible answers to each question. This greatly helps elucidate the idea into a concrete specification. I answer all those questions in one go, and ask the LLM to refine the description with those answers. I take this refined description, edit it with any further changes I have, and repeat this process in a new chat. Rinse, repeat, until the questions become silly. I usually end up with 3-5k word description of the idea itself with zero talk about technology or implementation. Then I shift gear and ask a (usually a different) LLM to generate an architecture based on this project specification. Edit this, ask the LLM to ask clarification questions and provide possible answers about this architecture. Rinse, repeat. I end up with a 10-12k architecture document. Now you can convert this into an implementation plan, again using the same process with the help of LLMs.\n\nYou don't seem to have a clear idea of what your app/startup should look like, which is fine. Rubber ducking is something LLMs are really good at.\n\nDon't waste time worrying about scalability. If you ever get to the point where the code can't scale, that's the best kind of problem to have, because you'll have plenty of cash to throw at the problem. Focus entirely on building something that works, even if it's ugly spaghetti code. Getting something working and testing with users is way more important than clean code or scalability.

Now you can convert this into an implementation plan, again using the same process with the help of LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t seem to have a clear idea of what your app/startup should look like, which is fine. Rubber ducking is something LLMs are really good at.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t waste time worrying about scalability. If you ever get to the point where the code can&amp;#39;t scale, that&amp;#39;s the best kind of problem to have, because you&amp;#39;ll have plenty of cash to throw at the problem. Focus entirely on building something that works, even if it&amp;#39;s ugly spaghetti code. Getting something working and testing with users is way more important than clean code or scalability. You can always refactor later.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
