At least similar in VRAM, Tensors, etc.\n\nI also prefer to use CLI only, because I want everything to eventually be for a robot I'm working on (because of this I don't really want a UI interface). For some I haven't fully tested only the CLI, and for some I've tested both. I will update this post when I do more testing. Also, feel free to recommend any others I should test.\n\nI will say the UI counterpart can be quite a bit quicker than using CLI linked with an ollama model. With that being said, here's my personal \"rankings\".\n\n* **Bark/Coqui TTS -**\n   * **The Good:** The emotions are next level... kinda. At least they have it, is the main thing. What I've done is create a custom Llama model, that knows when to send a \\[laughs\\], \\[sighs\\], etc. that's appropriate, given the conversation. The custom ollama model is pretty good at this (if you're curious how to do this as well you can create a basefile and a modelfile). And it sounds somewhat human. But at least it can somewhat mimic human emotions a little, which many cannot.\n   * **The Bad:** It's pretty slow. Sometimes takes up to 30 seconds to a minute which is pretty undoable, given I want my robot to have fluid conversation. I will note that none of them are able to do it seconds or less, sadly, via CLI, but one was for UI. It also \"trails off\", if that makes sense. Meaning - the ollama may produce a text, and the Bark/Coqui TTS does not always follow it accurately. I'm using a custom voice model as well, and the cloning, although sometimes okay, can and does switch between male and female characters, and doesn't sometimes even follow the cloned voice. However, when it does, it's somewhat decent. But given how it often does not, it's not really too usable.\n* **F5 TTS -**\n   * **The Good:** Extremely consistent voice cloning, from the UI and CLI. I will say that the UI is a bit faster than using CLI, however, it still takes about 8seconds or so to get a response even with the UI, which is faster than Bark/Coqui, but still not fast enough, for my uses at least. Honestly, the voice cloning alone is very impressive. I'd say it's better than Bark/Coqui, except that Bark/Coqui has the ability to laugh, sigh, etc. But if you value consistent voicing, that's close to and can rival ElevenLabs without paying, this is a great option. Even with the CLI it doesn't trail off. It will finish speaking until the text from my custom ollama model is done being spoken.\n   * **The Bad:** As mentioned, it can take about 8-10 seconds for the UI, but longer for the CLI. I'd say it's about 15 seconds (on average) for the CLI and up to 30 seconds (for about 1.75 minutes of speech) for the CLI, or so depending on how long the text is. The problem is can't do emotions (like laughing, etc) at all. And when I try to use an exclamation mark, it changes the voice quite a bit, where it almost doesn't sound like the same person. If you prompt your ollama model to not use exclamations, it does fine though. It's pretty good, but not perfect.\n* **Orpheus TTS**\n   * **The Good:** This one can also do laughing, yawning, etc. and it's decent at it. But not as good as Coqui/Bark. Although it's still better than what most offer, since it has the ability at all. There's a decent amount of tone in the voice, enough to keep it from sounding too robotic. The voices, although not cloneable, are a lot more consistent than Bark/Coqui, however. They never really deviate like Bark/Coqui did. It also reads all of the text as well and doesn't trail off.\n   * **The Bad:** This one is a pain to set up, at least if you try to go the normal route, via CLI. I've only been able to set it up via Docker, actually, unfortunately. Even in the UI, it takes quite a bit of time to generate text. I'd say about 1 second per 1 second of speech. There also times where certain tags (like yawning) doesn't get picked up, and it just says \"yawn\", instead. Coqui didn't really seem to do that, unless it was a tag that was unrecognizable (sometimes my custom ollama model would generate non-available tags on accident).\n* **Kokoro TTS**\n   * **The Good:** Man, the UI is blazing FAST. If I had to guess about \\~ 1 second or so. And that's using 2-3 sentences. For a about 4 minutes of speech, it takes about 4 seconds to generate text, which although isn't perfect, it's probably as good as it gets and really quick. So about 1 second per 1 minute of speech. Pretty impressive! It also doesn't trail off and reads all the speech too, which is nice.\n   * **The Bad:** It sounds a little bland. Some of the models, even if they don't have explicit emotion tags, still have tone, and this model is lacking there imo. It sounds too robotic to me, and doesn't distinct between exclamation, or questions, much. It's not terrible, but sounds like an average Speech to Text, that you'd find on an average book reader, for example. Also doesn't offer native voice cloning, that I'm aware of at least, but I could be wrong.",
