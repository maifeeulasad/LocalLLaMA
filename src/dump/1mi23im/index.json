So to say they &amp;#39;LLM&amp;#39;s have no future&amp;#39; is to tell me that I have to go back to hand-writing every line of code. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are they a panacea. Nope. Are they AGI? Not yet, maybe not ever. But we did pass the turing test a year or so ago, and no-one really noticed. Even if LLM&amp;#39;s never go beyond their current state, I think they&amp;#39;ll find their niche uses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That said, I hope they are replaced with something brighter, shinier and better!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
