It’s not a proper family of models and everything they distilled was really trash because the training data was so bad.\n\nIt had a 128k context window and dropped off a cliff in heavy context. Sure it was open source but it was a lie you could run it at home for the cost. It wasn’t as good as sonnet 3.5 that came out six months before it. Sure that’s closed source but at that stage your paying for interface any way. In all my hundreds of tests it took longer and costs slightly more than sonnet 3.5 in agentic coding as it just makes so many more mistakes. \n\nI know you likely don’t understand the value of a model family like qwen it’s harder to do and qwen was pushing the boundaries with much smaller models that were not that far off in actual real world performance and time/cost to solve a problem.\n\nThe reason llama models go so popular and useful is because it was a family and you could fine tune many versions for your use case. Deepseek was just a single model release and everything else was trash distill that caused large confusion like oh you can run this on your laptop with people thinking the 1.5B fine tuned trash was the same thing…..",

It’s not a proper family of models and everything they distilled was really trash because the training data was so bad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It had a 128k context window and dropped off a cliff in heavy context. Sure it was open source but it was a lie you could run it at home for the cost. It wasn’t as good as sonnet 3.5 that came out six months before it. Sure that’s closed source but at that stage your paying for interface any way. In all my hundreds of tests it took longer and costs slightly more than sonnet 3.5 in agentic coding as it just makes so many more mistakes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know you likely don’t understand the value of a model family like qwen it’s harder to do and qwen was pushing the boundaries with much smaller models that were not that far off in actual real world performance and time/cost to solve a problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reason llama models go so popular and useful is because it was a family and you could fine tune many versions for your use case. Deepseek was just a single model release and everything else was trash distill that caused large confusion like oh you can run this on your laptop with people thinking the 1.5B fine tuned trash was the same thing…..&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

They had bots out in full force pushing it despite it being ok not amazing and certainly nothing close to the cost being claimed.\n\nSo naturally people get skeptical, qwen doesn’t play this type of game and pretend they don’t use the latest nvidia GPUs and release a closed source open weights model with pretty much Chinese propaganda all over it.\n\nThough we have real risks building on Chinese models. It’s with nothing I accept those and use qwen models for now. Deepseek I’m way less of a fan of. I was not really that impressed \n\nHere come the Chinese bots with the downvotes.",
