I'm not focused on any specific topic, the model must be \"balanced\" for an all weather use.  \nI know i won't get a Gemini 2.5pro equivalent working on my computer, probably not even 10% of it's capacities, but i'm looking for the best i can achieve with my current setup.  \nwhat are your recommendations ?   \n\n\nThank you all !",
