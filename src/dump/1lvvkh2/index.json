It did complete it after a few prompts and it also fixed one error that happened in the javascript console.\n\nIt did spend some time thinking, but not as much as I have seen other models do. I would say it is doing the middle ground here, but I am still to test this extensively. The model card claims you can somehow influence how much thinking it will do. But I am not sure how yet.\n\nIt appears to wrap the final answer in &lt;answer&gt;the answer here&lt;/answer&gt; just like it does for &lt;think&gt;&lt;/think&gt;.

I will test 6 bit and 8 bit also, but I am quite in love with the speed of the 4 bit and it appears to have good quality regardless. So maybe I will just stick with 4 bit?\n\nThis is a 80b model that is very fast. Feels like the future.\n\nEdit: The 61 GB size is with 8 bit KV cache quantization. However I just noticed that they claim this is bad in the model card, so I disabled KV cache quantization. This increased memory usage to 76 GB. That is with the full 256k context size enabled. I expect you can just lower that if you don't have enough memory. Or stay with KV cache quantization because it did appear to work just fine.
